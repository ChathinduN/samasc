                    <p class="content">This is gonna be a long post and I am back after a long time. I saw a few problems which must be addressed and we got to discuss them because they are harming the perception of brown men.

It first starts with all the simping brown guys do especially for brown women. Simping is first of all very superficial and comes off as very desperate so how do you think that will make women respect you? Women like men who have self respect and if someone says otherwise, they are telling you about an imaginary utopia. The Bollywood industry while it had some good movies push this simp stereotype of brown men. There was this one movie I watched where a man hanged posters of a girl around her town and creeped her out but eventually, they both fall in fall. This reinforces and pushes brown men to be a bunch of simps and pedestalize Desi women. Do Desi women do the same for brown guys? Look at the power imbalance. We have so many freaking Ashwin's (ugly ABCDesis stalker mod) and spineless ABCDesis cowards in our community and I see that this sub has those idiots gravitating towards here. If you want a brown gf, build yourself up and ask yourself if you are the ideal guy any woman wants to date? Do you look fit, do you dress well, do you have proper hygiene, are your social skills decent? I purposefully left out brown before woman in the last second and forget about brown woman in the context of this conversation, are you that ideal person or do you just cope. Even then, if you build yourself up to be the ideal man you wanted to become you shouldn't simp for women. Think about this, a 7/10 brown guy would willing go for or settle for a 4/10 brown girl but do you see the opposite happening now as much? Do you think the same will be afforded for us men, no. As Desi men, we have to be above average in average aspect and there is no problem with that. A chip on shoulder makes us way better but know your place and have your own standards. Brown women know that there are armies of Ashwin and pathetic ABCDesis cucks that will give them validation. Do you think the exceptions we are making that they will make the same exceptions for you? Build some self respect.

Also lets touch on the next topic and talk about brown women and their lack of accountability when it comes to showing support for brown men. You see on tiktok when Avaneesh post how everyone collectively come to bash him from brown boys, brown girls, and people of other races. Avaneesh is a self hating creep so it's justified, no one is complaining. What about the countless Avaneesha's (brown girls) in our community? People are quick to bash the Avaneeshes in our community but they don't hold the Avaneesh's accountable. Case in example below:

[https://www.tiktok.com/@its\_nupur/video/7387072011165748526?is\_from\_webapp=1&sender\_device=pc&web\_id=7183457373357966894](https://www.tiktok.com/@its_nupur/video/7387072011165748526?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7183457373357966894)

Girls can make derogatory tiktoks being racist to brown men and there would be absolutely no accountability for it. I don't want to hear all the where did you find it or deviate from the main discussion. Try saying this from a brown guys perspective and see how quickly you would be called self hating, a Bobby Jindal, and a bigot. All the comments I see from people here are defending her saying "relax its a joke" or "you are so insecure." If a guys posts something like this, he can risk losing sponsorships or a job. We need to hold brown women to the same accountability like brown men are held too. Another example is if a brown guy dates outside of his culture, they are looked down upon by brown woman as self hating but for a brown woman it is empowering and gives them more freedom. Don't you see the double standards? The ABCDesis simps will cower to them in hopes of getting laid to only be used as a doormat. Hold your own woman accountable for their internalized racism. We will never be white and neither will they. If our own people do not stand up for each other, then who will? Unchecked behavior for a long time can run rampant and you have a bunch of loser simps enabling it or even being indifferent. Don't be afraid to call out any self hating brown girl or report her comments to her employer, maybe she will then understand the consequences of her behavior. Brown girls that thrown brown men under the bus aren't the allies. Talk about our issues with people and let them know that we will stand up and we aren't afraid to fight back.

Brown guys in the west are driving change and I see a bunch of brown guys trying to improve their soft power because we are basically forced too. That is the reality we have but it's one I embrace because it makes us better at dealing with adversity. For brown women, they don't need to work out or take care of themselves because they can always fall back to the Ashwin type simps. This was a long post and I would like to have a discussion with everyone about like the double standards they have witnessed.</p>
