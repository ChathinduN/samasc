                    <p class="content">I’ve been thinking a lot about why so many Asian men are getting pulled into the Red Pill and manosphere. I get it—these spaces seem to offer answers, especially when we’re dealing with the racism that desexualizes us and leaves us struggling with dating and masculinity. 

But here’s the problem: the manosphere isn’t built for us. In fact, it often does more harm than good. Yeah, it talks about improving yourself, but it’s wrapped in bitterness. Every interaction becomes a battle, and women get reduced to objects you’re supposed to “control.” 

For us Asian men, it’s even worse. The same racist hierarchies that keep us at the bottom in society are right there in the Red Pill. Terms like “ricecels”and “currycels” are just another way to keep us down while pushing outdated ideas about dominance and submission. 

On the flip side, the Asian American community isn’t really helping us out either. The Red Pill might be toxic, but at least it's offering something—even if it's the wrong thing. Meanwhile, the Asian American community often stays quiet about the unique struggles we face as Asian men in dating and society or just blames Hollywood and the media.

I mean, they're right, but blaming institutions doesn't help the individual person through their lived experiences. There’s no real support or alternatives, so we end up stuck, with no one talking about how to deal with racism and cultural stereotypes in a healthy way.

So where does that leave us? The Red Pill isn’t the answer, but neither is pretending the problem doesn’t exist. I don’t have all the solutions other than showing Asian men that they CAN find their personal happiness, but I do think it’s worth talking about how both of these spaces are failing us—and what we can do to build something better for ourselves as Asian men.
