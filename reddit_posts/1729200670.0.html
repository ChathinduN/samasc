                    <p class="content">I've been thinking of creating a new discord/reddit community focused on combating various anti India/ anti-Hindu trends. I'm not sure exactly how its going to pan out yet but I cannot sit and watch our communities being dehumanized any longer. Nothing radical, lmk if anyone is interested this is going to help desis abroad more than mainlanders. People who want to take up lead roles and/or have any ideas are also welcomed. This community will also double as a safe space for South Asians of all ages.</p>
