                    <div class="content"><p>Many men are innocently believing that their dating life would improve in places where number of women are higher than number of men, they would be free from male "competition" and that women would flock to them.</p>

<p>However the answer is NO.</p>

<p>The single most important factor that they forget is the HERD MENTALITY of women.</p>

<p>If majority of women in the environment find you "handsome", then sure, you are in for a ride.</p>

<p>However the HERD MENTALITY will ensure that even women who would otherwise find you attractive, will fall prey and get influenced by other women who will effectively kill your chances with that girl (knowingly or unknowingly)</p>

<p>Men have better chances with a woman when they are alone with her or even if there are multiple other men competing with him for that woman. But NEVER with a group of women, especially the gossip types. The girl gossip is enough to bury your chances forever even if you're Hrithik Roshan lite.</p>

<p>What are your observations about this phenomena?</p>
