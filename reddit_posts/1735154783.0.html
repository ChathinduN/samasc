                    <div class="content"><p>I spend a decent amount of time reading about the Indian Subcontinent. I'm no historian, but I've found that reading about our history has opened up more doors for me to craft my own narrative. I don't see things exclusively from a Eurocentric point of view anymore. Western Media whitewashes it's evils and paints the "other" as a villain.</p>

<p>For example, we all unanimously agree that the Nazis and Hitler were an evil force, yet I could poll most Westerners and they have certainly would have no concept of the basic facts on the atrocity that was the Bengal Famine, or how Churchill cut from the same cloth of racists that believed in White Supremacy; to many Indians starving and dying by the millions, he may as well have been Hitler.</p>

<p>In the modern context, the racism and gaslighting by Eurocentic media persists. It's not going to be news to anyone in this subreddit that South Asians are having an incredibly difficult time in matters of representation. We see what's really going on here, but we struggle to do anything about it because we lack significant cultural and social capital. We overwhelmingly outperform in the tech, medicine and finance sectors worldwide, and yet we lack control of the narrative.</p>

<p>The narrative we instead are fed <em>about</em> ourselves and <em>about</em> our ethnic brothers and sisters is this:</p>

<p><em>"India is a shithole filled with rapists. Indians are extremely racist and misogynistic. India is dirty and that Indians lack even the most basic concepts of hygiene</em>."</p>

<p>It's unfortunately the case that many of these accusations have elements of truth in them. We've all seen the videos of Indians sitting in soot or dust cooking and making food. We're all aware of the Nirbhaya case and the rampant misogyny that fueled that horrific crime. We're all aware of the pollution and corruption and the racism.</p>

<p>But ask yourself: <em>why is India like this?</em> How does a Region of the World that once held up to a <em>third</em> of the Global GDP fall to a piddly 3% in the 1940s? How does India go from being a cultural behemoth to being relegated as an obscure nation with an undermined and overexploited working class?</p>

<p>The answer is clear. The British Raj explains the current state of India, and <em>more than that</em>, explains the destiny of Indians, mainland and NRI, in the present. It's going to be impossible to lay out the entire history of the Raj in a reddit post, but here are some things that are important to understand.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is a very easy fact to forget, but the British occupied India from 1756-1947. That's nearly 200 years of exploitation and rapacious plunder. India has only been free for 77 years. <strong><em>77</em></strong>.</li>
<li>India globally was not a site of low-skill manufacturing the way it is now. India before the Raj was a hotspot for high-skill artisanal work. Textiles woven to feel as "light as air", Wutz steel as strong if not stronger than Damascus, Boats that helped the Chola Dynasty develop a Thalassocracy in the Indian Ocean, and much much more. This changed when the British destroyed Indian industries because they felt they were too competitive for British industries. They destroyed warehouses and pushed out Indian industry because of their economic insecurity. What's tragic is that because of this, we've lost methods today to make some of the mentioned textiles.</li>
<li>Economist Utsa Patnaik tracked export reports coming out from India through the records the Raj left. She estimates that had this wealth been left in India, and invested with a compound interest of 5%, India would be <strong>$45 trillion</strong> richer today. An astronomical figure that might even be conservative if we estimate slippage, criminal theft under the Raj and a number of other factors where shipments were not recorded.</li>
<li>India before the British Raj was actually more liberal in it's attitudes towards sex and individualism. The most obvious evidence of this is the existence of the Kama Sutra, but India has long accepted the existence of Hijras, and women dressed fairly liberally throughout many different periods in Indian history. A major event that changed India's attitudes towards sexuality were puritanical Victorian values that adhered to strict, sexually repressive mannerisms. These attitudes were forced on Indians, creating the monster we see today. In fact, it may have been been the case that the British were in many cases engaging in sexual violence against Indian women during the Raj, a fact I <em>never</em> see brought up anywhere that could further explain the attitudes towards sex in India.</li>
</ol>

<p>These 4 facts I argue, explain why India is the way it is today.</p>

<p>India was destroyed, violated and stolen from.</p>

<p>Consider that theft is not only "kind of" bad, but an evil thing to do at the scale of empire because humans need resources to thrive. We need stable infrastructure, we need food and water, we need shelter to survive. Primary resources meet our basic needs first, so that we can explore secondary needs and actualize ourselves, as per Maslow's Hierarchy.</p>

<p>When the British took the $45 Trillion in resources from India to fund <em>their</em> nation, this came at an opportunity cost for <em>Indians</em>. The British built and accelerated the development of <em>their</em> infrastructure, <em>their</em> housing, <em>their</em> culture, <em>their</em> educational institutions, and <em>their government</em> at the expense of <em>our</em> development and progress as a civilization. Many Indians lack the basic infrastructure to meet their basic needs, let alone self-actualize.</p>

<p>The British stole not only our present during the British Raj, they stole any hope for a future in India for centuries. The stole any and all economic opportunity that could have arisen from the expansion of industry in India. In the world we live in today, if economic incentives aren't present, we're forced to look elsewhere, and many look towards the West.</p>

<p>If you're an NRI, you need to this understand this:</p>

<p><strong>Colonization is reason why we live in the West, and not in India.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of living and thriving in our homeland, our parents made the choice to find economic opportunity in the lands of the very people who stole it all from us: The UK, Canada, Australia, even to some extent the US.</p>

<p>In the words of activist and writer Ambalavaner Sivanandan:</p>

<p>"<em>We are</em> <strong><em>here</em></strong> <em>because you were</em> <strong><em>there".</em></strong></p>

<p>This simple statement defines your entire life. Everything about you are is predicated on living in the West, and that was determined for you before you were even born. The bullying, the gaslighting, the confusion around who you are, it all stems from this simple fact.</p>

<p>If you're a mainlander in India, things are just as bad, if not worse.</p>

<p>Economic brain drain from India to the West means India loses out on the people who would otherwise help build India back into what it could be. This continues the cycles of poverty in India. Poverty fuels a lack of education, which in turn reinforces more sexually conservative values, leading to the kinds of misogyny and racist tribalism we see today. In a cruel twist of fate, the very colonizers who stole basically everything from India and crippled it now viciously mock it. What I urge mainland Indians to do here is to not forget who created these conditions for you.</p>

<p>This is why understanding history is important. We are being lied to day in and day out. Every day. we are being conditioned to hate ourselves. To paint our skin lighter, to distance ourselves from the heritage, to laugh meekly at mockery of our culture and way of life. You can't begin to understand why the world is conspiring against you if you don't understand the events that preceded everything. South Asians look far too favourably on places like the UK and too unfavourably on each other. This frankly, needs to change.</p>

<p>We need to understand where we are ALL coming from and work towards a future armed with the lessons of our past.</p>
