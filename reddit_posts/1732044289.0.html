                    <div class="content"><p>In a social setting, I'm always proactive but not the "fun" person. Always took my sweet time and generally prefer speaking to people along or in smaller groups.</p>

<p>Never got along with any "oversmart" person but always got along with people who "listen" and maintain "mutual respect". Or simpler to say got along well who watch what they speak (irrespective of whether the person is genuine or has any ulterior motives, quieter people are always likeable)</p>

<p>Neverthless, sometimes also got along with the same "oversmart" people when I'm alone with them rather than a group where they start their "verbal diarrhea".</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why I get along well with older colleagues rather than the peers of my page. Also in the long run, these character traits helped me widen my circle since I would run into assholes more than often and I found another "better behaved" person when I spoke with more new people.</p>

<p>More context - weak area are "fun" and "banter", strong areas are talking to "good listeners", "light-hearted jokes" or even "dark humour without personal remarks"</p>

<p>What are some tips you would give me? (some practical examples or real-life anecdotes are preferred rather than generic responses)</p>
