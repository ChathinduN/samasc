                    <p class="content">M22. Still don't know how to ride a bicycle coz never had one growing up. Father had a broken bike which he never bothered to teach me to drive. Not even habitual on sitting on bikes/cars.  
How to learn cycling? And more importantly, will I be able to learn the informal road protocols ( like unsaid rules which should be known while driving ).   
All reactions welcomed. </p>
