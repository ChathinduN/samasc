                    <div class="content"><p>20M, California, USA, I fucking hate how much other people hate us so much, Every time I open instagram, I see people hating on Indians for no good reason, and every time we stand up for ourselves, we get ganged up on by these slimy peckerwoods, everytime I stumble across a "What race would you not date?" video, I already know the fucking answer, this shit is fucking up my mental health, I am trying the best that I can, I am gonna crash out, Please, do something for our representation and reputation, PLEASE, PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU, I can't stand to see my people getting disrespected any longer, YES, I UNDERSTAND that some street food might be disgusting to look at, but that doesn't mean that it's like that everywhere, why do people hate us so bad, NOW I AM ON GUARD EVERY TIME I SEE SOMEONE, PLEASE HELP, I AM GONNA CRASH OUT, IN FACT I AM CRASHING OUT AS I AM TYPING THIS! AND DON'T YOU DARE COME AT ME WITH BASIC ADVICE LIKE "Oh you gotta love yourself", that is bs, I get that you need to love yourself, but what's the point of doing that if your people are getting slandered on the internet by slimy motherfuckers on all sides for no good reason, and they come up with bogus claims to justify their hate. SOMETHING HAS GOT TO CHANGE, YOU GUYS HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. There are videos that address this hate, and even there, motherfuckers talk about how bad we smell, and the street food, FUCK THIS</p>
