                    <p class="content">Y'all bois in Gen z, Gen alpha, and younger have an environment where race matters least in terms of looking good and being fashionable. I get it some millennials and older guys in here have suffered, but there's absolutely no reason for young guys like you to be moaning about race etc...

Why? because nearly all of the styles and aesthetics that Gen z, alpha, and younger find attractive are really well suited for your features. 

You have great hair that you can form a perm or a fringe with. You can look good in baggy pants, oversized shirts etc... You don't have to be from a specific race or ethnicity to pull off these kinds of looks. Girls in your generation love these kinds of looks. 

You have access to tons and tons of fitness and nutrition content on TikTok and Youtube. A lot of you also have really great skin textures and skin tones that you can really show off if you follow a basic skincare routine. 

You don't have to fit racialized aesthetics such as old money, jock, rapper, or thug like the millennials did. You can just be you while pulling off these younger, newer, and fresher aesthetics. 

It has never been easier to look good and to be fashionable. Take advantage of this environment. </p>
