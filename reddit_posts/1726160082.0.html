                    <p class="content">Approach anxiety is something we all experience, especially with the added pressure that comes from stereotypes and societal perceptions of Asian men. But instead of letting that hold us back, we can use science-backed techniques to reframe how we deal with anxiety.
I wanted to share two approaches that have worked not just for me, but for many other Asian men I’ve coached:

1. Power Posing
Harvard research shows that by standing in a “power pose” for just two minutes, your body chemistry changes. Testosterone (the hormone linked to confidence and assertiveness) goes up, and cortisol (the stress hormone) goes down. When your body shifts like this, your mind follows. Think of it as sending a signal to your brain that says, “I’ve got this.” It’s a powerful hack that can help with anything from approaching women to dealing with everyday stress.

2. Anxiety Reappraisal
Here’s something interesting: The physical signs of anxiety are almost identical to excitement. Studies show that by reframing anxiety as excitement, we can actually improve performance in stressful situations. For example, instead of telling yourself, “I’m nervous to approach her,” try saying, “I’m excited to meet someone new.” This small shift in mindset can make a huge difference in how you handle social situations.

These techniques are grounded in psychology and biology, and while they won’t make anxiety disappear overnight, they will help you manage it and approach the world more confidently.
