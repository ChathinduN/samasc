                    <div class="content"><p>Separate from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-doge-marko-elez-musk-vance-racist-posts-959272aca0eece7385cdbc470930bf37">Vance's recent greenlighting an anti-Indian racist in the White House (Marko Elez)</a>, which itself was vile, <strong>Vance's comments on X suggest unique hostility to S. Asians</strong>.</p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1891553587970380152">he wrote to Mehdi Hassan</a> (an Indian-American on MSNBC, originally from England),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Yes dummy.</strong> I think thereâ€™s a difference between not giving a reporter a seat in the WH press briefing room and jailing people for dissenting views. The latter is a threat to free speech, the former is not. Hope that helps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1887958058342502623">he said to Indian-American congressman Ro Khanna</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the sake of both of our kids? <strong>Grow up.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don't threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. <strong>A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1887960225195638848">also</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't worry about my kids making mistakes.....</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You disgust me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's worth noting that Hassan and Khanna <em>didn't insult Vance</em>, or begin the ad hominem.  </p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1891462732240638280">see how he respectfully treats a disagreement with a white American</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This is an odd criticism, and makes it seem like you read the social media clips but not the full speech</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The tone Vance uses when talking with South Asians seems charged</strong>.   Call them <em>dummies</em>, telling them to <em>grow up</em>, saying they <em>disgust</em> him, calling them "<em>whiny</em>".</p>

<p>Meanwhile for other whites, <em>he treads carefully, referring to their criticism as merely "odd" but talks to them with respect</em>.</p>

<p>I scanned Vance's X comments for similarly personal disrespect towards whites and I didn't see it.   Worth noting that neither Ro nor Mehdi provided a great response to being dissed by Vance; which likely just emboldens him.</p>

<p>I understand Vance as VP is being wielded by the President as an attack dog.  His talk in Europe was also tough.  It's not the toughness I am objecting to; <strong>it's the lack of respect, the lack of basic civility when he's talking to South Asians</strong>, in contrast to whites.</p>

<p>I'll point out two examples I have with whites on this subject.</p>

<h1>First Example: Former Manager</h1>

<p>I once worked for a VP.  7 of us were seated around the table: 5 white, 2 Indian.  When the whites spoke, he looked at them and listened carefully.  When either Indian spoke, he looked angry and distracted, <strong>sending a clear message that we were not to be listened to or respected</strong>.</p>

<p>The difference in how he responded to whites and South Asians was evident; it was <em>meant to be picked up on by others in establishing a kind of racial hierachy</em>.</p>

<h1>Second Example: White Male who married an Indian wife</h1>

<p>This white guy was friendly and talkative, at first.  Over time, as he got more comfortable, when he came to a social event where it was mostly Indian, <em>he became haughty and dismissive</em>.  As if he could elevate himself by talking down or ignoring Indians.</p>

<p>I bring these up because they relate to how Vance can, <strong>through a simple tonality change, signify respect to one group (whites) while modeling disrespect towards another</strong> (Indians).</p>

<p>And also that even though Vance has married an Indian wife, there is a trend I've seen of such white men, who begin with openness and mutual respect, but <strong>later become arrogant and dismissive</strong>.</p>

<p>My experience is their scorn towards Indian men seems to come from insecurity.  Just like WM do the same to Asian men, even if they date an Asian woman.</p>

<h1>Takeaway</h1>

<p>There's no point dumbing this down to Right vs Left, or "durr they're racist what do you expect?".   It's a matter that involves some degree of nuance.</p>

<p>Most people will not even pick up on this dimension, but slowly but surely, the leaders of our nation model new behavior for how certain people are thought of and treated.</p>
