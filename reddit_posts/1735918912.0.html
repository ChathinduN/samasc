                    <div class="content"><p>Elon Musk has been on a tear lately, <strong>dramatizing the grooming scandal by South Asians in the UK, even though it was over more than a decade ago.</strong></p>

<p>This guy is trying to get South Asians killed.  (And I do not care one bit what position he has on H1B- no Indian diaspora cares about that.  They care about the racism surrounding the discussion, and the racism that bigots like Musk are spreading.)</p>

<p><strong>Here he is saying South Asians committed the worst crime against the British people EVER:</strong></p>

<p>"The worst mass crime against the people of Britain ever"</p>

<p><em>Apparently the Nazi Germany Blitz on London known as "Black Saturday." doesn't count.  348 bombers and 617 fighters dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs, resulting in approximately 430 civilian deaths and over 1,600 injuries.</em></p>

<p><strong>Was Rotherham wrong? Yes, were people hyperbolic and claiming 1 million British girls were affected? Yes.</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>For background on Roterham scandal:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal"><strong>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal</strong></a></p>

<p>But Elon, being an unapologetic racist and with wealth and connections that puts him above it all, <strong>doesn't care repeating that misinformation on a platform he owns.</strong></p>

<p>This South African interloper harmed his ties with other white racists over his selfish money-grubbing H1B stance, so now he's doubled down that he's the white leader of the disaffected white population.  He sided with Indians on H1B (again, we don't care) so <strong>now he feels he has to win points with the racist alt-right crowd and savage Indians by bringing up something from long ago.</strong></p>

<p>Though 10 years ago, he reposted this which was about proceedings that happened reviewing that incident from bigot Tommy Robinson and many others - all spotlighting Rotherham:</p>

<p>How coincidental that all these people are posting about Rotherham, 10 years ago, claiming South Asians mass raped girls- just after the H1B debate.</p>

<p>This is part of a power play by conservatives in the UK to seize power from Labour, but Elon is adding gas on the fire.   </p>

<p>Should we bring up the MeToo rapes and spotlight all the white men who violated women back then- some with dozens of rapes?   Let's bring back and discuss as relevant today all the white mass murders including adults shooting children in schools.   Let's make that the front burner issue.  This is what happens when you have a race to the bottom.  We can all fight dirty.</p>
