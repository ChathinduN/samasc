                    <p class="content">I was chilling with a group of friends when one white person started NPC talking that Indian are rapists.  Never been to India.  

I know itâ€™s easy to just consensually agree but I had to take over the conversation and re-educate them that this is a racist connection 

Any patriarchal society has shown mistreatment of women 

In Japan in socially acceptable to see sex workers within a marriage.

They are reported rapes and murders in South America all the time

In Russia they have been reports of women being treated like commodities.

In Australia they the British settlersused to tie up aboriginal women in the back of their property to be used for solely sexually gratification.

The connection between Indians and mistreatment of women is unfair untrue and racist 

It allows female abuse to continue in other countries </p>
