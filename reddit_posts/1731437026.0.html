<p>I'm worried this radfem self hate is genuinely going to destroy our community. I read a comment in abcdesis subreddit that put me in a doomer mood. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1goeeo6/comment/lwp074d/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1goeeo6/comment/lwp074d/</a></p>

<p>I'm hoping that this isnt what actually happens (because our women will literally be fine with us being put in gas chambers if it means they get to climb up the social ladder, or in this case get elon bucks ) . Indian "radfem" movement , unlike korea's where women literally get assaulted for coming out as a "feminist" or usa with the men literally bragging about being able to rape women (tiktoks of women experiencing "your body, my choice" spam) is simply centred around bashing men for clout and money, instead of seeking genuine disbandment of patriarchy.</p>
