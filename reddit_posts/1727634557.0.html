                    <p class="content">I recently turned 27 back in June.

Went on a couple of dating apps aimed at South Asians.

I get a lot of attention but it almost seems like these brown women are moving desperate. 

First few messages of some conversations and the girl asks "what are your intentions? Are you looking to get married"

I mean, sure, I'd like to get with a woman someday, in a healthy marriage. But I don't even know these women first of all, these are random strangers and that's the first thing you ask?

I said to one girl "you know, if you're meeting someone new, the best thing to do is have no expectations first hand, because, we quite literally don't know each other"

Then she accused me of being a time waster
