                    <p class="content">I know this feels like a toddler post but do you think if we are faced by protests and hate the way jews went thro in last year. Or like Chinese or korean can faced asian hate during covid. Can we face real threats not just singular attacks but something like that ? Or we just cope by calling ourselves peaceful? </p>
