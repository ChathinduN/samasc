                    <div class="content"><p>It’s a new year, I’ve just finished watching the fireworks similar to you</p>

<p>Time for us to set new goals</p>

<p>But think back to last year, you already set so many goals in January that were given up by March and April</p>

<p>I want you to experience the satisfaction of achieving a goal set by yourself which took me years to finally feel. It’s one of the best feelings you could experience, and a lot better than the pain of not making any progress at all.</p>

<p>For this year, think back to the inputs required to reach your goal</p>

<p>Figure out what you need to do each month, week and day to reach the goal and have a daily system which makes sure the action needed to achieve your goal is done.</p>

<p>This seems like an overreaction or ‘taking it too serious’ but write out what can you each month, week and day to reach the goal. I’m doing it with you right now.</p>

<p>For example, my goal is to get stronger at weighted pull-ups, if my goal is to pull with 60 kg</p>

<p>Each month I’d check if the weight keeps going up. Each week I‘d make sure I’m performing enough sets of pull-ups. Each day I’d hit my calorie target, train in the gym and sleep 8 hours when I can.</p>

<p>My ’system’ is having all of the necessary habits done together to make it extremely easy. It’s waking up, having a meal, going to the gym then having another meal after which gets most of the work done in a 2 hour block.</p>
