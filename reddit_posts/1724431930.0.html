                    <p class="content">Then we'd finally see more athletes. A lot of this food would have to produced industrially and would only work for urban populations. Other stuff, like beans and sweet potato, can't be done industrially.

**Dosa** - The ingredients would be brown rice, corn, and oat, in that order for amount, for the grain part, soy instead of lentil, and finally a bit of millet. The inside would be sweet potato and yam in that order for amount. This would be eaten for dinner with minimal spices, preferably none. You shouldn't be eating spicy food for every meal.

* **Brown rice, corn, and oat** - Before cooking, these should be soaked in a microbial mixture, not regular water. Some bacteria and yeast will enter the grains and digest them from the inside, but most will attach to the seed coat on the surface and digest that. Ferment them for 30 hours, drain, don't rinse, and let them start to sprout for maybe 2 days, don't worry about the corn. No need to eat white rice when you can do this to remove the negative side effects, keep all the nutrition, and get more protein. Corn and oat are already whole.
* **Soy** - We heard of the problems soy poses for men. Fermenting and sprouting make it worse unless you do this after. Soak the soybeans in microbial mixture as described above. The exact same things will happen. Let them ferment for 30 hours, drain, and let them start to sprout for a week, rinsing and resoaking every 2 days. At the end, freeze them, thaw them, and rinse the thawed soybeans. The isoflavones will be gone after this. Whether that's a good thing or not is another story.
* **Millet** - Soak and add them to the soy and grains above when blending. No need for other prep.
* **Sweet Potato and Yam** - Cook them like a potato, but don't remove the skin. The skins are edible and nutritious.

**Sourdough Roti and Beans** - Roti/Rotli/etc. is unleavened whole wheat bread. Just about the worst form of bread you could eat. Regular cooked beans don't help you all that much. But rotli and shaak is a staple. It can be improved.

* **Whole wheat sprouted sourdough** - Soak whole wheat berries in a microbial mixture, and otherwise do the exact same thing that was done for the grains in the dosa. At the end, feed the sprouted, fermented wheat berries through a meat grinder. The resulting dough can be used to either make rotis immediately, or left to ferment additionally for naan.
* **Beans** - Don't use soybeans here. The reason India never picked up soybeans is that soybeans aren't cooked easily. For any other beans, soak them in a microbial mixture (even a spoonful of yogurt mixed in water is good enough since this is not done at a factory), and let them ferment for 30 hours. Drain them, and let them sprout if you want. Pressure cook them, rinse them in water after pressure cooking, and then proceed with the other normal cooking steps.

  
Dosa batter and rotis can easily be made in factories and sold in costco quantities. When I eat them cooked the way I described, I feel the same rush of energy and mental clarity that I feel after eating meat.</p>
