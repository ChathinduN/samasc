                    <p class="content">The city that I live in has a huge culture of people carrying a lot of stuff with them, like multiple bags, and layers of clothing or maybe cycling gear etc. I almost always have a big bag pack with me as well. So I would say something like “hey its getting a bit warm, do you maybe wanna take your jacket off? I can put it in my bag for you”. I just make stuff up depending on the situation and take a small non important item from my date, keep it in my bag. And for most of my dates, its mostly chilling in a park and smoking a lot of weed and having beer or wine. So by the end of the date both of us are so stoned that we have absolutely forgotten about whatever item of her I have in my bag and that gives us a reason to meet again.

Mostly my first dates just end up in hookups but so I dont do any of it but if I am trying to see someone a bit long termish then this trick always gets a me second date.</p>
