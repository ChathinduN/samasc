I ran across this and it's an obvious issue that we face as South Asian men in America.

Has anybody ever swapped phones with male friends or colleagues and looked at their Hinge accounts? We did this the other day at my gym for shits and giggles.

The white personal trainers at my gym get more and higher quality matches than the small handful of minority clients (most of whom are consistent with their workout routines / in great shape and have elite careers).

Is this an American centric problem, and has anyone done better in specific cities as well as other countries?</p>
