                    <div class="content"><p>So as you all know TikTok is on track to get banned here in the United States on January 19th. That means you won't be able to download the app after that date. The supreme court, however will be hearing arguments against its ban on January 10th, but I honestly don't think those will go very far as this was a decision made by congress.</p>

<p>So why do I think the TikTok ban will be bad for brown guys?</p>

<p>Well because I see a lot of thirst for brown guys on TikTok by not just brown girls, but girls of all backgrounds. It is not rare at all to see girls making TikToks saying brown guys are their type etc... I've seen TikToks like these from brown girls, black girls, some white and asian girls too.</p>

<p>In general brown guys actually have a decent rep on TikTok and get thirsted on quite a bit.</p>

<p>I don't really see that much enthusiasm on Instagram... In fact I see a lot of scathing comments and hateful rhetoric on Instagram against brown guys. So if Instagram is pretty much going to be the sole replacement for TikTok, then it's not looking good...</p>
