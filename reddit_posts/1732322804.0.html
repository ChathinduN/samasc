                    <div class="content"><p>For some reason i felt as if this sub would be somewhat appropriate to help me make of this situation. This takes place at a large city in Europe.</p>

<p>So me and one of my uni mates visit a bar in my city and when we get there its kind of crowded, so we find a sort of large round table and ask the 2 people  if it was cool to use the other half of the table (it was like a 6 person table). The people there after some time appeared to be an Indian guy (brown skin and heavy indian accent ) and an Asian woman in what seems to be a date. </p>

<p>Me and my friend shoot the shit about our course or whatnot and we end up having a great time laughing around. I do sometimes get loud when I get exited but we were in a pretty loud bar as well. I also tend to make very dark and off color jokes while drinking with friends. I see the guy looking at me from time to time but i think nothing of it since we both are visibly Indian. </p>

<p>As they finish their drinks and get up the guy looks at me very annoyed and says something along the lines of “we were happy to share the table but you were being too loud” and “look at  your friend he is not making much noise”. He leaves pretty annoyed with his date. </p>

<p>According to my friend I was indeed kinda loud but we were also at a loud bar ( like an underground Cellar with a lot of people ) and so he was also kind of confused at that guys remarks. We even asked the next set of people after a while if we were being too loud as a frame of reference and they said they had no problem. </p>

<p>Even still being singled out by that guy kind of made me feel bad and think about weather i have any behaviours that i need to correct. My friend seems genuinely confused too and says he sees nothing wrong with how i was acting. We theorised that he was just pissed that we kind of ruined his date or that he was just some fob that didnt know how bars worked. But i still worry about weather i was somehow in the wrong </p>
