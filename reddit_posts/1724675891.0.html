I’m starting to see a lot of representation of brown women in western media. But nowhere is the desi male to be seen. As if they don’t exist. 

I find this stuff frustrating and you can see it in real life desi women don’t even want to associate with desi men. 

If your going to liberate desi’s liberate them all. 

The demonisation of desi men is all bs.

I’m done collaborating with this system. 

I’ll be writing content around desi masculinity where as desi men will improve ourselves in isolation to this rigged set up</p>
