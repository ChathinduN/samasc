                    <p class="content">Hey, I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking to get out of this discussion, but I've honestly felt a bit emasculated recently and I've never felt there was anyone who I could talk to this about.

What made me seriously consider this was when I liked this girl, asked her out, and I got rejected. She was the first girl I've ever asked out and I was friend zoned. We stayed friends, but later she would go on to say she liked masculine guys which indirectly implied I was not that. She did say she liked Conan Gray and thought he was masculine because he worked out though, so I'm not sure how much I can take away from that... but still.

Another event that happened, was when I was hanging out with another girl. I don't see her romantically, but we talk often enough to know each other pretty well by now. She's someone who talks a lot about how she's seen and how she sees others and commented that I'm not super masculine and she wouldn't question if someone said I were gay (I'm not).

I'm not a Tate fan, nor am I someone who doesn't care at all for anything traditional, but it definitely feels like being called not masculine is 100% a negative thing more than anything. Maybe not explicitly, but implicitly, and I'm not sure what to do or feel about it?

I'm 21M, 5'11/6ft and a college student in California. I've always felt a bit out of place as a guy since my own guy friends really got into sports and were outgoing/loud/outspoken while being shy, anti-social, or timid has always held me back. I never got into any sports in high school either since I was never good at basketball or things my friends played, but I go regularly go to the gym now. I'm a nerd in the sense that I like Pokemon and was a band nerd, but I'd say a lot of my interests are pretty standard guy or guy-dominated things: cars, working out, tech, finance, politics, etc.

I'm feel conflicted because I've had no relationships at all, and at least two girls have said that I'm not masc. One part is because of my parents placing a lot of pressure on me not dating (which is one issue) and another is definitely my personality and how I'm presenting myself. I'm not going to change myself just based on what they say, but at the same time, I feel like... I should be doing something? I feel like this is a topic to discuss in therapy, but I just wanted to share on here. This doesn't really have too much to do with my race/ethnicity other than the fact that my parents and culture do play a role in not emphasizing sports, being strict with friendships/relationships, not having much interests of their own, etc.

Is there anyone else who feels the same way?</p>
