                    <p class="content">The reason why no one takes us seriously, is because ppl know theirs no reprisals/consequences for fucking with Indians. I feel as if, we gotta make it a norm for every desi to get decent training in boxing and if someone runs their mouth we gotta smack em so they learn their lesson. Iâ€™ve been seeing videos on twitter from Germany, whereby Turks and afghans are fucking up the country but no one does shit cuz theyâ€™re afraidðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. The goal is to be feared but dont go out of ur way searching for trouble, only cause havoc when acted upon. Hopefully boxing and mma culture picks up in India as well. We need a firmware update as an entire ethnicity. This Ghandian shit ainâ€™t it.</p>
