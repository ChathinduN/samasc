                    <p class="content">Ok this is kind of another vent so be warned. I'm not trynna generalize. A lot of desi boomers (I'd say most) are great. Family oriented, want nothing but the best for their kids, socially conservative etc... I'm fine with those. They're great. 

There is however a vocal minority of desi boomers who make it their whole personality to act "modern" or "woke" and let their kids loose. These are the same boomers who broadcast how "progressive" or how feminist they are on their social media platforms. These kinds will aggressively suppress any minute amount of masculinity and aggression in their sons and will go gung-ho on the feminism aspect when raising their daughters. I think this group of boomers are very very annoying. The son usually becomes some gay or autistic incel and the daughter becomes some red/pink/blue/green haired banshee. 

It is important to call these people out because they had it a lot easier tbh. All they really had to do was get a job during a time where there was barely any competition. They did that and they think it's some kind of grand accomplishment that they should be celebrated for. Plus them acting woke on top of these advantages that they had is the cherry on top for me and really infuriates me. 

Whenever I meet some uncles and aunties that are like this I talk to them about this. I think y'all should point it out to them too. Even if they don't agree with you. </p>
