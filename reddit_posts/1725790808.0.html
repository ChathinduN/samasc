                    <p class="content">The first response in dealing with compulsive people is to straight-up tell them to back off.

But, it doesn't always work. They derive a sadist pleasure by being oversmart, making snarky remarks and becoming more compulsive after being told to back off.

My personal preference is to avoid them or to speak beyond their intellect level and control the conversation saying what I want to say instead of replying to what they say. In short, talking about topics where they can't say anything.

Any other tips you have to deal with compulsive trolls? (not online, in real life)</p>
