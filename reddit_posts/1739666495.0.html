                    <div class="content"><p>It's frustrating they selectively use biased information to make us look backwards, they actively avoid our history and science, they plagiarise our inventions and discoveries and then taunt us that we are poor(that too after stealing our wealth and genociding our ancestors) and uneducated, and to top it off we have soy cuck brown sepoys ready to lick their boots, for a whiff of their white racist's smegma. </p>

<p>How do we change this perception? Is it through economic power, media representation, cultural revival, or something else entirely? What can we actively do to shift the way we are seen on the global stage?</p>
