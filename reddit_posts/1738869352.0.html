                    <div class="content"><p>This question is mainly for British South Asians or those who understand how the class system works in general. Iâ€™ve noticed that middle class and higher classes British women are open to dating us (if we are middle class or higher ourselves) and middle class and higher classes British people are generally not racist towards us but working class British women and people are generally racist towards us so the working class British women are usually not open to dating us. Have you noticed this as well? Is there anything similar in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, et cetera?</p>
