                    <div class="content"><p>I am going to take a break from the game talk and talk about a different type of game, the beautiful game. One thing that gets me, given all that people say about the Desi diaspora outside of the US, is how our brothers in places like the UK have failed to break through in this sport despite the fact that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sport is bigger in the UK</li>
<li>The UK diaspora has had much longer to assimilate</li>
</ul>

<p>But it would be one thing if the entire Desi diaspora was struggling but I have noticed something else. The American Desi diaspora has started to outpace its UK counterparts. Let me offer some counterexamples from the recent decade.</p>

<p>The first American to ever get into Real Madrid's Youth Academy? An Indian kid from California!</p>

<p>That is a pretty big deal! Real Madrid is the best club in the world. Granted, he did not pan out but the feat is just remarkable. </p>

<p>You even have MLS clubs signing youth talent as seen below with this American Desi kid.</p>

<h1>Just what is the UK Desi population doing?</h1>

<p>I don't mean to diss our brothers abroad because they have their own unique set of issues but my god. By this point, we should have had at least a couple of prominent Desis playing in the Premier League. With all of the hype the Desis in Canada and the UK get for being more "macho" and "masculine", where the hell is the outcome?</p>

<p>Where are the Desis playing for Man United, Man City, or Arsenal?</p>

<p>Like even Tottenham is having a Korean player breakthrough in a big way but what is happening to the Desis in the UK?</p>

<p>Given the higher amounts of blue-collar Desis who have been there longer, one would think by now we would have had a brown Messi or at least a brown world-class player for the UK.</p>

<p><strong>In fact, the underperformance of Desis in futbol is so sad that even Austria has a Desi on their team.</strong></p>

<p>Austria has a Desi playing on their kid, how many Desis are there in Austria?</p>

<h1>My prediction.</h1>

<p>I think that at the rate we are going, giving how much the US is now investing into soccer and how Desis from The Bay Area are breaking through, our first Desi superstar in the beautiful game might come from the UK. He might even come from elsewhere in Europe or even mainland India. It does not seems like the UK Desi population is stepping up in the sport anytime soon.</p>
