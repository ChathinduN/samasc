                    <div class="content"><p>Blaming their race makes them ignore their other flaws. This is inspired by u/theasianplayboy and his recent submission.</p>

<p>I find that with Asian and Indian men, minorities in the game community in general, there is this whole self-defeatist attitude around "but white guys have it made and I am screwed because of my race so why bother?". Here is the issue I have noticed time and time again, in fact, I notice it more with Asian and Indian men than any other race.</p>

<h1>Men are woefully unaware of major flaws that can be fixed because they are so fixated on blaming their race.</h1>

<p>The amount of Skinny Fat, chubby, or just super skinny Indian dudes I have known with poor hygiene who blame women for being prejudiced is through the roof. But the thing is, these dudes are so obsessed with blaming race and blaming prejudice that they never fix them. So what you have is some skinny fat Indian dude with a sloppy haircut and poor fashion blaming women for being prejudiced because they went for a Chris Hemsworth lookalike.</p>

<p>And the best part, it is only because he was white because "Just Be White". </p>

<p><strong>Asian and Indian men need to be real with themselves.</strong></p>

<p>I have some breaking news, if you are crying on Reddit and the internet about how girls hate Indians, you are probably not even good-looking for an Indian guy. I know your mom told you that you are her little cute angel but it is time to let go of the sari. You probably aren't even top 20% of attractiveness when it comes to Indian men out there but you speak as if your failures are solely due to your race and nothing else.</p>

<p>It gets me that so many Indian men who are not attractive attempt to speak for the experiences of all Indian men, especially the handsome ones out there doing well. </p>

<p><strong>But so many guys are overlooking serious flaws they can fix when doing this.</strong></p>

<p>You could be hitting the gym and eating right.</p>

<p>You could be working on getting fitted clothes.</p>

<p>You could get that awesome haircut.</p>

<p>You could fix your eyebrows.</p>

<p><strong>And we are just getting to the tip of the iceberg here.</strong></p>

<p>We have not gotten to "Inner Game".</p>

<p>We have not spoken about how crappy your mindset and vibe are compared to the Chad or Tyrone you envy.</p>

<p>We have not started to speak about how you probably make women go dry the second you speak.</p>

<p>We have not even started about how all of what you post online probably sticks in your subconscious mind and makes the alerts go off in the heads of women who are avoiding you for good reason.</p>

<p><strong>Can we talk about "preferences" and "prejudice" all day?</strong></p>

<p>I am not saying prejudice does not exist, it most certainly does. In some parts of the world such as Toronto or Vancouver, I would never want to be an Indian guy because of just how bad it is. However, whatever the prejudice might be out there, most of you are not even giving yourself a fighting chance.</p>

<h1>The reality is, most white guys don't have it as made as you may think.</h1>

<p>I would encourage all of you to hang with some tall white guys and see how it goes but in hanging with them for years, a lot of them are plain average in the dating results department. Some may have success but these guys are outliers. Most guys, regardless of race, are struggling, hence the incel epidemic.</p>

<p>Chances are, the tall white guy out there getting results is doing things in a way that you are just missing. Hang around him enough and overtime, you will realize just what he is doing. There is probably something off about you subconsciously that you need to seriously work on and once you do, you will realize how much of this was actually on you.</p>

<p>Just don't wait, I have seen Indian men wake up and realize this at 50 and by then, its almost too late.</p>
