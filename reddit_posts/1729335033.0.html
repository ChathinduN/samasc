                    <div class="content"><p><strong>TLDR</strong> at the end for u <strong>low attention span</strong> mfs (but you'll want to <strong>read</strong> this in its <strong>entirety</strong>).</p>

<hr />

<p>"Endian men ugly saaar".</p>

<p>"Women don't like Eindian men saaar"</p>

<p>"Eindian men genetics baad saaar"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These are the kinds of ghey ass <strong>narratives</strong> that run <strong>rampant</strong> on this sub. Kid you not before I joined this subreddit I actually had a decent outlook on life and a positive perception of my ethnicity. It all changed when I joined this place during the <strong>lockdowns</strong>. All of a sudden I felt <strong>undesirable</strong> and <strong>ugly</strong> after reading some of the sh*t on here. This severely affected my <strong>mental health</strong> and outlook on life. I can’t believe that these narratives have so much presence on this sub.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I actually started <strong>believing</strong> and <strong>internalizing</strong> these inc*l ass narratives.</p>

<p>The funny thing is when I recently checked up on the people who posted these kinds of things I'd notice that all their <strong>accounts</strong> had suspiciously been <strong>deleted</strong>, <strong>banned</strong>, etc… Makes you wonder how many of those <strong>chutiyas</strong> were <strong>trolls</strong>/<strong>larpers</strong>/<strong>bots</strong>.</p>

<p>Super <strong>frustrating</strong>. This meant I got worked up over nothing. It was all just <strong>vaporware</strong>, typical <strong>NGMI</strong> (not gonna make it) <strong>propaganda</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>My experiences pulling girls off of dating apps etc… do not match up with the overall  vibe of this subreddit whatsoever. Ya boi here got a little curious again as to see what he could get in big 2024 so got onto a dating app a few hours ago and getting hits already. I'm not actually back into dating, but was just curious as to see what I could get with some of my old pictures. Hence it's a <strong>LIMITED RECONNAISSANCE.</strong>  </p>

<p>I'm getting <strong>compliments</strong> and sh*t on my <strong>physique</strong>, <strong>features</strong> etc… I would have never thought that I would have gotten such compliments especially after <strong>training</strong> my <strong>mind</strong> on a lot of the <strong>content</strong> of this sub. Something I noticed was these girls were being quite <strong>proactive</strong> (asking me <strong>questions</strong> about <strong>my life</strong> etc…) I know they're not <strong>bots</strong> because I got their <strong>snapchats</strong> after we met off the app.</p>

<p> I guess the <strong>key</strong> really is to get them off of the app and get them onto anything else, could be <strong>Snapchat</strong>, <strong>IG</strong>, <strong>iMessage</strong> whatever. </p>

<p><strong>1.)</strong> Started chatting on snapchat with this first chick after we matched. She said she found me handsome. Easily a 7/10 chick. Redacting her face and name for <strong>obvious</strong> reasons.  </p>

<p><strong>2.)</strong> Started chatting on Snapchat after matching with this other 6/10 girl. She said she like my <strong>bod</strong> (lean).</p>

<p><strong>3.)</strong> Had a <strong>facetime</strong> with prolly a 5-6/10 girl (not fat or anything just features didn't appeal too much to me she had <strong>curly hair</strong>). She said she liked my brow ridge. She said it was <strong>"bold and defined"</strong>. Couldn't record the <strong>facetime</strong> for obvious reasons, but yeah even though I didn't find her to be super attractive, she was still <strong>kind and courteous.</strong></p>

<p>So my message to y'all <strong>Indian studs</strong> is that your <strong>features</strong> are indeed <strong>valued</strong> and <strong>desired</strong>. Don't believe most of the <strong>fudd</strong> on this sub or similar ones. <strong>Enjoy</strong> your life. Keyword: <strong>ENJOY</strong>. Pulling is going to be <strong>20x</strong> harder if you have all this <strong>reddit crap</strong> at the back of your mind as you're trying to run <strong>game</strong>.</p>

<p> This is my <strong>last fuccin interaction</strong> with social media for a hot minute because I desperately need to save my <strong>career</strong>. This social media shit is so <strong>addicting</strong>. I'm honestly kind of <strong>upset</strong> that I let social media affect me this much :(</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: this place is often an <strong>echo chamber</strong> and can <strong>bogg</strong> you down <strong>if you let it</strong>. Just know that it isn't as bad as the inc*ls on reddit make it seem. They're pretty much trying to <strong>gatekeep</strong> women away from you. I am now familiar with their tactics. They're just trying to reduce the competition for themselves. They try to convince you that u are ugly and undesirable so that <strong>you take yourself ou</strong>t of the dating pool. Don't fall for it, don't let them drag you down. This dating pool is indeed <strong>FAVORABLE</strong> for <strong>YOU</strong>!</p>
