-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



"Endian men ugly saaar".

"Women don't like Eindian men saaar"

"Eindian men genetics baad saaar"

 

These are the kinds of ghey ass **narratives** that run **rampant** on this sub. Kid you not before I joined this subreddit I actually had a decent outlook on life and a positive perception of my ethnicity. It all changed when I joined this place during the **lockdowns**. All of a sudden I felt **undesirable** and **ugly** after reading some of the sh\*t on here. This severely affected my **mental health** and outlook on life. I can’t believe that these narratives have so much presence on this sub.

The worst part is that I actually started **believing** and **internalizing** these inc\*l ass narratives.

The funny thing is when I recently checked up on the people who posted these kinds of things I'd notice that all their **accounts** had suspiciously been **deleted**, **banned**, etc… Makes you wonder how many of those **chutiyas** were **trolls**/**larpers**/**bots**.

Super **frustrating**. This meant I got worked up over nothing. It was all just **vaporware**, typical **NGMI** (not gonna make it) **propaganda**.

 

My experiences pulling girls off of dating apps etc… do not match up with the overall  vibe of this subreddit whatsoever. Ya boi here got a little curious again as to see what he could get in big 2024 so got onto a dating app a few hours ago and getting hits already. I'm not actually back into dating, but was just curious as to see what I could get with some of my old pictures. Hence it's a **LIMITED RECONNAISSANCE.**  

I'm getting **compliments** and sh\*t on my **physique**, **features** etc… I would have never thought that I would have gotten such compliments especially after **training** my **mind** on a lot of the **content** of this sub. Something I noticed was these girls were being quite **proactive** (asking me **questions** about **my life** etc…) I know they're not **bots** because I got their **snapchats** after we met off the app.

 I guess the **key** really is to get them off of the app and get them onto anything else, could be **Snapchat**, **IG**, **iMessage** whatever. 



**1.)** Started chatting on snapchat with this first chick after we matched. She said she found me handsome. Easily a 7/10 chick. Redacting her face and name for **obvious** reasons.

**2.)** Started chatting on Snapchat after matching with this other 6/10 girl. She said she like my **bod** (lean).

**3.)** Had a **facetime** with prolly a 5-6/10 girl (not fat or anything just features didn't appeal too much to me she had **curly hair**). She said she liked my brow ridge. She said it was **"bold and defined"**. Couldn't record the **facetime** for obvious reasons, but yeah even though I didn't find her to be super attractive, she was still **kind and courteous.**



So my message to y'all **Indian studs** is that your **features** are indeed **valued** and **desired**. Don't believe most of the **fudd** on this sub or similar ones. **Enjoy** your life. Keyword: **ENJOY**. Pulling is going to be **20x** harder if you have all this **reddit crap** at the back of your mind as you're trying to run **game**.



 This is my **last fuccin interaction** with social media for a hot minute because I desperately need to save my **career**. This social media shit is so **addicting**. I'm honestly kind of **upset** that I let social media affect me this much :(

 

**TLDR**: this place is often an **echo chamber** and can **bogg** you down **if you let it**. Just know that it isn't as bad as the inc\*ls on reddit make it seem. They're pretty much trying to **gatekeep** women away from you. I am now familiar with their tactics. They're just trying to reduce the competition for themselves. They try to convince you that u are ugly and undesirable so that **you take yourself ou**t of the dating pool. Don't fall for it, don't let them drag you down. This dating pool is indeed **FAVORABLE** for **YOU**!
