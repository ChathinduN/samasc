                    <div class="content"><p>I'm failing my lock-ins and frankly it's getting kind of annoying. I haven't been having the best year. I broke up with a girl I loved because it was not a stable relationship. I fell in love again and lost that girl as well probably because of issues she had. I won't say I fumbled it because everything was going perfectly so fortunately I don't blame myself for it but I could've had better control over my thoughts and actions. I've always had issues with <strong>self control and mental strength.</strong> </p>

<p>I had a great amount of discipline in me and I've demonstrate it to myself studying 4 months straight and killing it on an exam that got me into a good school with scholarship. <strong>I don't get late to important things.</strong> I lost about 12 kgs but I'm not sure how much of it I credit to starvation rather than discipline. I cook my own food, very high protein, best ingredients, don't drink/go to restaurants/order 90% of the year. But I think it's far beyond the level of exceptional I want to be. </p>

<p>My university years I got too much attention from women for my own good and now I'm far from that person. It's weird how I feel that person was sometimes happier, maybe peaking where I have all this potential sitting on me. <strong>I want to make music, I want to get in better shape.</strong> </p>

<p>But I'm a huge slave for attention that I don't usually receive in healthy ways, probably having sex with a woman about to be engaged next month, or having too many bad dates before either party ghosts, getting attention from exes who are dating new people already are enough things about me to make me hard to like myself. <strong>I fell off my moral high horse when I realised humans aren't perfect but somehow started using it as an excuse to be problematic.</strong> <strong>I made my own rules for drinking and smoking up but I don't think I regulate myself enough. I'm smoking up too much and working out a lot less. My gums are unhealthy. Oh, and in case that wasn't messed up enough, I've recently gotten back to NSFW content as well.</strong></p>

<p>I want to help myself. <strong>I want to get better.</strong> Can someone please say something. <strong>Why am I enslaved by my wants instead of my needs and goals?</strong> </p>
