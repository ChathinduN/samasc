                    <div class="content"><p>Hi All,</p>

<p>A little background on me below to get a picture. </p>

<p>Age: 27M
Ethnicity: South Asian (Born &amp; raised in USA)
Height: 5’10
Income: 130K+
Body: Lean/Athletic</p>

<p>Ok now to it. My mind is blown. I live in one of the largest cities in the US and on dating apps I literally get NOTHING. No pity or chats no likes no matches. Occasionally I get the morbidly obese girl like me maybe once a month or later. </p>

<p>I’ve been in Thailand for 2 days and I have over 500 matches on dating apps and have met with several of them. I FINALLY LOST MY VIRGINITY. </p>

<p>I guess I’m posting this because I can’t believe how brutal the blackpill is for non whites in the west. Based on my “stats” you’d think I’d at least get some matches on dating apps in the US but no. </p>

<p>People say PeRsonAlity but brothers you don’t show personality before even matching on dating apps it’s just pictures and a short bio. </p>

<p>Normies also say get off the dating apps. Bro I’m 27 I’d say everyone uses the apps and no one cold approaches this isn’t the year 2003. </p>

<p>Idk I guess I’m just ranting I really don’t want to go back to America. </p>

<p>I digress </p>
