                    <div class="content"><p>While genes play a role in height, I think many Indians are reaching heights below their potential because of a lack of calcium in their diet during puberty.</p>

<p><strong>The amount of calcium needed in the diet is underestimated.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CDC recommends 1300 mg of calcium for teens between 9-18 years old. For context, there are 305 mg of calcium in one glass (244 grams) of milk. This means a teen needs around 4 glasses of milk a day (around 1 kg) to meet the requirement</li>
<li>For calcium absorption, sufficient Vitamin D is required. The skin can create vitamin D from sunlight. The <a href="https://www.britishskinfoundation.org.uk/sunlight-and-vitamin-d">British Skin Foundation</a> recommends daily sunlight exposure of 10-15 minutes for lighter skin and 25-40 minutes for darker skin for sufficient Vitamin D.</li>
<li>Dairy is one of the densest and most reliable sources of calcium which is why doctors recommend drinking milk to grow taller. Some of the tallest nations consume high amounts of dairy (e.g. Nordic Nations and the Balkans). The Dinka Tribe, who are known to grow to an average of 6 feet, engage in pastoralism (rearing of cattle) and rely on cows for milk and meat.</li>
<li><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5684325/#:~:text=Countries%20in%20Africa%20and%20South,greater%20than%201000%20mg%2Fday.">Calcium intake is tied to the average height of the nation</a>. Countries in Asia (&lt; 500 mg/day), Africa, and South America (400 - 700 mg/day) have lower calcium intake leading to shorter citizens. Northern European Countries are the only nations with a daily calcium intake of greater than 1000 mg/day.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Indian Diet on average is very poor in calcium.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33889131/#:~:text=About%2085%25%20of%20the%20Indian,negative%20consequences%20on%20bone%20health.">study</a> found that 85% of the Indian population suffers from a Vitamin D deficiency despite abundant sunlight. This led researchers to suggest that the Vitamin D deficiency was induced by a calcium deficiency. In another study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523280260">South Indian Urban men</a> had an average calcium intake of only 323 mg/day.</li>
<li>Foods like Paneer or buttermilk can be rich in calcium. Meanwhile, curd isn't a particularly calcium-dense source with 187 mg of Calcium per 225 grams. Many Indians tend to mix curd with rice substituting calcium with carbohydrates. Keep track of your calcium intake if you are on an Indian diet.</li>
<li>While many Indian children consume a glass of milk every day, factors like adulteration in India and high sugar content from milk powders (sugar might reduce the absorption of calcium) can reduce the daily calcium intake. Also, remember that 1-2 glasses of milk a day don't meet the daily calcium requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What if you can't consume Dairy?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Many Indians might experience gastric issues or bloating when consuming too much milk as a significant amount of the population <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/gastrointestinal-articles/lactose-tolerance-in-the-indian-dairyland">lacks the genes to digest lactose</a></li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/food-sources-calcium">list</a> contains a list of foods that are rich in calcium. Food sources like spinach, plant-based milk, tuna, and fortified juices contain high levels of calcium.</li>
<li>Worth considering Calcium supplements.</li>
<li>However, milk might give a small boost to height by stimulating Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF). According to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/health/milk-children-height-study/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFor%20example%2C%20a%203%2D,'re%203%20years%20old.%E2%80%9D">study on the effects of milk alternatives on height</a>, children drinking plant-based milk were slightly shorter than people who drank cow's milk.</li>
