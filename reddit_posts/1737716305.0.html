                    <div class="content"><p>Hello everyone, </p>

<p>I have been strength training regularly for over 5 years now and have made progress. The training plan I follow is based on scientific papers and the exercises, training sets, repetitions, frequency and rests have been optimised on this basis. The training plan has a slight focus on lateral shoulder and lateral muscle laxity. It is also adjusted slightly on a regular basis (approx. every 6-8 months). At times I also booked a personal trainer to optimise my training plan and nutrition plan and to gain some knowledge about execution, nutrition and the transcycle. What strikes me now is that my friends (not South Asians - partly European, Arabs and blacks) - I have to say that I perform badly in direct comparison. I pay extreme attention to my diet, macros, proteins, training and intensity. In contrast to my friends, some of whom don't stick to their diet at all or don't train regularly - but achieve similar if not better results.</p>

<p>This situation doesn't really motivate you. </p>

<p>That's why it occurred to me to perhaps do strength training optimised to my genetics in order to achieve better results. Do you have any success and experience that you can share with me?</p>
