                    <div class="content"><p>Have they achieved white acknowledgement and pulled the ladder from us? It‚Äôs seriously time for us to form an anti racism campaign. It‚Äôs high time for us to call out people who are racist to Indians while being against racism or any sort of bigotry to blacks or the LGBT.</p>

<p>To have stardom as an Indian in America is a huge step for us. But to just skirt by in the shadows of white folks is a stab in the back to all of us at this time.</p>

<p>When are they going to step up? Mindy, Kal Penn, and the others? </p>

<p>It‚Äôs seriously now or never. If our celebrities don‚Äôt step it up we are going to lose this battle. The entire Indian community has acknowledged the recent surge in racism against us while the majority of the west laughs at us. They must be thinking <em>the media is against you, not for you</em></p>

<p>The defensive wall that Indians are putting up, saying ‚Äúthey are jealous of us‚Äù because of our incomes and hard working students is laughable. No, they are not jealous of us. We are different from them and they have not been instructed by the media that they should be nice to us. Without the media, the majority of people cannot think for themselves.</p>
