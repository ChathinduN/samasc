                    <p class="content">And I gotta sayâ€¦. Canadas got a serious problem man. Dirty looks cause Iâ€™m brown, people ignoring me, everyone being mad rude all the time. I went to LA and Vegas for a week and everyoneâ€™s smiling saying hi, random conversations with people on the street or at the store, not ONE comment about me being a brown person nothing! I didnâ€™t see many other brown people but I did see a few and no one saying anything about them either! I even saw some brown boys with hot white girls and I was so happy to see it! Guy wasnâ€™t even tall or jacked he was regular and his girl was bad. I legit had a smile! A lot of Asian and white peoples and hispanics in LA but everyone was very welcoming and friendly and talked about random things! At an In-N-Out had a conversation with a random lady for like 10 minutes and she was mad chill too!!

So guys donâ€™t worry about the shit you see in Twitter if youâ€™re living in the US or something. A lot of people donâ€™t hate desis and I have a good feeling that most of society in these big societies have either little experience with us and it was more than likely positive experiences! When I came back here at the airport I already ran into rude border officers ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­</p>
