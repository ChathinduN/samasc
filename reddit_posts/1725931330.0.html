                    <p class="content">I live outside Boston. Parents immigrated in the mid 70's. Married a white woman almost 20 years ago and she just left, so i'm a single brown dude in a very white northeast suburb. 

Just bought a boat. Been taking it out with my kids, nieces / nephews, and friends. And one thing i've become crystal clear on: It's the whitest hobby. Whiter than skiing. 

I'm done trying to fit in. I want to own it. 

Thinking of starting a brand (literally for myself because I have yet to see another brown guy on a lake in NH or boston harbor) called Brown Boi Boating. Going to come up with a simple logo and screen that on the back of a t shirt. Also gonna put big block letters on the front. 

Do you think it's too on the nose? Why shouldn't i do this?

I hate feeling like a visitor in my own home. I hate knowing I'm more of a local than most of these clowns but having to check myself around them because at my age (42) most local white guys I know are  only about 2 beers away from going full racist. 

I want to own the fact i'm a fucking baller who happens to be brown. Deal with it.</p>
