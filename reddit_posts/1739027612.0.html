<p>To be honest I understand the sentiment. I genuinely don't think of non-desi men as humans, however I usually adore their women. Quite often on this sub, you will get a Indian guy talking about "double standards" when he brings up "WMIF/XMIF should be encouraged too!!" in response to pro IMWF/IMXF posts, and gets derided like the subhuman he is. </p>

<p>You need to change your perspective, starting from daily life. When you see a non desi man, the image inside your head should be of a rotting rat, a half crushed rabid animal, anything that reinforces that the guy you are looking at is only relevant in how he can advance the subcontinent's or subcontinent diaspora's causes. Conversely when you see a white, asian , latina, or black woman, you should immediately be filled with a sense of euphoria- thinking about their doe eyes, their beautiful features, politely flirting with them if you sense interest ,etc. his is not a "double standard" .</p>

<p>Something is evolutionarily wrong with you if you think IMXF and XMIF should be treated  "equally" -You are a biological danger to your tribe. Put the "other" men in the mines, army and back breaking hard labor, put the "other" women in your bed. That's the normal way of thinking. Any mode of thinking that deviates from this is abnormal and unethical (to your tribe), and you need to recalibrate your worldview.</p>
