                    <p class="content">I know you guys are seeing a ton of these posts it’s annoying but serious question:

How to meet women once I graduate school? I finish in under a year. I go to a commuter college and my major is killing me lmao I don’t have time to meet anyone and the travel is 1 hr+ one way. Once I’m done from here though and (hopefully) find good work, where exactly do I meet girls properly? I’m kinda confused on that part. Apps don’t really work for me and I live in a suburb of Toronto right now. Don’t really plan on staying in Canada long term anyways. 

Give me some pointers. Also can be any girl brown white black Hispanic whatever I don’t care i just gotta put myself out there not sure where to go though. Ex girlfriends I had I met in high school or IG, and right now in my friend group no one’s got a girl except one guy, and his situation is a whole different story

Thanks  

Oh and also at my uni I tried talking to like 20 girls since the year started but they’ve all been kinda cold, and the numbers or socials that I DID end up getting or if I caught a vibe, we’d text or talk for a week and then nothing after that. Or, I get hit with the “I got a bf” everytime </p>
