                    <div class="content"><p>So I don't have many of these anecdotes, but an interesting incident took place a few days ago I'll share here since I think it's relevant.</p>

<p>So on Christmas Eve 'Eve', I'm standing in line for the self-checkout in a UK supermarket, with a packet of stuffing in one hand. It's that time of year, so it's a <em>long</em> line. I'm standing casual, one hand in pocket, chill, patiently waiting. </p>

<p>As the line moves forward a few times, I notice someone is stopping very close behind me, as in invading my personal space. I look behind me and there's a tall white guy there. I'm 5'10, but this guy towered over me, so he must have been at least 6'3. And let's just say he looked the type to have been in those racist anti-immigrant riots half a year ago. Indeed, he gave me a clear stare of disgust, and stood close and tall, clearly trying to intimidate and humiliate. </p>

<p>Now, what he didn't know, since I was relaxed, wearing a very thick jumper (sweater for you Americans) and not facing him, is that I am jacked, and although I stopped a few years ago, trained in amateur wrestling for a few years. I'm not an unconfident or incapable guy.</p>

<p>So I take my hand out of my pocket, turn sideways to him, put on a 'ready to go' threatening stance and start to not so subtly flex my pecs and biceps while staring him out. </p>

<p>All of a sudden the wind goes out of his sails. He starts keeping a few paces distance when the queue moves forward, and is now avoiding eye contact with me, despite the fact I'm staring at him. I keep my threatening stance, clench my fist a few times, eventually cross my arms to show off what he's up against. He doesn't want any of it. His (male) companion, presumably a relative, notices the tension and tries to defuse it, funnily enough, by talking about how much he loves Indian food, and asking the other guy which supermarket he thinks does the best Indian food. The other guy is just mumbling responses quietly. Eventually I stop staring and go back to my queuing. </p>

<p>Now here's the interesting part. There was a supermarket employee. She was white, had brunette curly hair and blue eyes, a solid 8/10. Now not to be rude, but most supermarket employees are shall we say.....older and rounder, so she stood out. In the time I was queuing, she left and returned to the self-scan area 3-4 times. And on each return trip, she made prolonged eye contact with me each time, and smiled widely. </p>

<p>I don't know for sure, but I suspect she saw what happened. Now if I had lost my temper, got openly aggressive, or dragged the guy to the floor and choked him out (my plan if he got physically aggressive), in addition to the severe risk to my career (I work in the legal field), it's likely she would not have been as impressed. The fact I was able to subtly (and not so subtly) dominate the space against a much taller guy with my physical strength, confidence, and control of myself and my response, showed masculinity, and made him look weak and cowardly.</p>

<p>It did not matter that Apu has a funny accent, Raj is awkward around women in TBBT or that social media talks trash about Indian men all the time. Or that white guys have all the social privilege and advantage in society. In that incident, I was the superior man, and an attractive woman from his race saw it (don't know if he saw that, but if he did, even better). </p>

<p>So I don't care if you're short. Get to the gym. And if you can take up wrestling, boxing, kickboxing, etc, get to it. Don't start fights. Or flip off the handle at the slightest provocation. But if someone tries to be obscenely (and probably racially) aggressive, let him know that <em>you</em> control whether he gets out of the situation he created safely or not. </p>

<p>And control is masculine. </p>
