                    <div class="content"><p>Most recent study done by Newsweek shows India 99.31  right around that mean of 100 and ironically the United States has a lower iq 98 than India. </p>

<p>I'd reckon if you looked at things in quartiles India is significantly higher filtering out the lowest quartile people that are malnourished, illiterate etc. </p>

<p>There are already several studies within the US that shows iq broken down by groups. For some reason the racists keep parroting this "ok India average iq is 67" tier nonsense and disregarding actual stats like this.</p>

<p>There is a country by country breakdown included and Sri Lanka is also at a very respectable 102. This is actual a recent study done last month unlike troll nonsense. </p>

<p>Also comically Canada has gone up 3 points to 102.6. Maybe influx of all the Indians ðŸ˜‚
