                    <div class="content"><p>Unfortunately almost every desi guy I know who goes to the gym is on some kind of enhancer whether it be testosterone or other things, they lift for while, see little improvement then just hop on cycles.  Truth is we need to work harder for the same results, generations of a vegetarian diet plus famines have fucked our genetics up and we need to stop the cycle now. We also need to educate our own community about things like protein powder, creatine, animal protein etc. Some of my friends (mfs that are 20+) have to hide protein powder and creatine from their parents (under the bed, in the attic, university locker etc) because creatine = cocaine to desi parents. Got other friends that hide their meat-eating habits from their parents because they would get in big trouble so they constantly eat meat out because they got nowhere to cook meat. Our culture around all this needs to change our skinny fat/pot bellied elders are the last people that should be giving nutritional advice. </p>
