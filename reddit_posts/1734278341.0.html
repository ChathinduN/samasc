                    <div class="content"><p>(If it's too much to read check out TL;DR at the bottom!)</p>

<p>So, for starters I am 23 years old Sri Lankan Tamil born and raised here. So, no accent, even got a Anglo first name, 5ft9 (175) height and am medium dark skinned. I got friends here and obviously have assimiliated myself entirely. Yet, I still struggle heavily with dating. Now, I already know certain things I need to work on (mostly my physiqe) but the things I DON'T know how to improve is what to dress like, my Tinder profiles here in Sweden and how to actually talk to them, aka game.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that for a very long time I didn't really have any interest in women at all. Because I was waiting for the "one". I know this is cringe asf but I really believed in finding your soulmate and getting married. Recently I kind of realized that it doesn't exist but also my priorities have now changed.  So for the last 1-2 years I've mostly been talking to women outside of Sweden on apps like Discord and Yubo. I've been successful in getting nudes and such and having dirty talk but obviously nothing more then that.</p>

<p>But when I talk to women from my town here, either on IG or Snap or Disc, it almost never goes anywhere.</p>

<p>For the most part I have streetwear on with flashy jewellry. But that's all I've known but I'm willing to expand my horizons now if that is what it takes for me to change things. I feel like this urbanwear style is either a hit or miss and it doesn't have a constant "success rate".</p>

<p>And as for Tinder, I have never used Tinder before. So, I have no idea what types of photos to have nor what vibe and style I should present. I really don't know if the "badboy" "streetwear" "thug" type of look is a hit or miss on Tinder here, nor in real life. As I said, I am looking for any and all input and I am willing to change. Having streetwear is not a must for me.</p>

<p>So for those of you who have either dated Swedish women in Sweden OR you actually live here (regardless if you moved here or were born here like me) and date Swedish women, I'd like y'all opinion and advice on what type of style works best for the girls here, what type of photos and clothing style should I have on Tinder and how should my "game" be when talking to Swedish women?</p>

<p>TL;DR Tell me what type of photos I should have for Tinder in Sweden, what type of style is most appreciated in foreign men (blattar såsom vi säger här lol) both irl and on Tinder, and the best way to actually talk to Swedish women aka game.</p>
