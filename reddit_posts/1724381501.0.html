                    <p class="content">We're wondering why we suck at the olympics. But I look at Southeast Asia, MENA, latin America, and even the mediteranean countries, and they all kinda suck.

Here's what I think - once you get past a generation or two of hybrid vigor, with dilution and crossover, gene variants that evolved together for polygenic traits are not inherited together, and that results in an averaging effect. The way to use the hybridization as a benefit is to keep it below 20% to buff out the "problems" that you evolved.

But it's okay - there are 5000 castes in India who rarely married out for 1900 years. Caste difference is almost the same as race difference now, even if its not measured by current genetic variables. Inter-caste marriages are increasing, and that hybrid vigor will kick in. India is the most genetically diverse place outside Africa, and that will be reflected in the Olympics eventually.</p>
