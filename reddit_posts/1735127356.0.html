                    <div class="content"><p>As someone who is proactive but not a social bee yet, there are a few observations where it's NOT RECOMMENDED to start a conversation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Most obvious situation, when eye contact is avoided not once but multiple times. Especially if you have previously attempted to start a conversation. If you believe people are shy to the point of repeatedly avoiding eye contact even after conversing previously, I don't have anything left to say.</p></li>
<li><p>People wearing earphones or busy on something. Not suitable to approach someone who is busy unless and until it's work-related or anything official.</p></li>
<li><p>Stopping a person to talk when they're is rushing to another place.</p></li>
<li><p>Approaching people who are trying to be alone.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Or else by any chance, do you still recommended to start conversations in any of the above situations? What are some more situations you would like to add here?</p>
