                    <div class="content"><p>For context I have been what brown families would call a successful kid growing up, I worked for a while and I'm now pursuing my master's in the US. The job market I'm applying for is insufferable and I feel I no longer care about my career and my life is going on a downward spiral.</p>

<p>I try to provide optimism to my friends who feel the same but deep down, I have none left for myself. Just wanted to rant, anyone else facing the same?</p>
