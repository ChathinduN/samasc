                    <p class="author">Posted by: <a href="https://reddit.com/u/TheDesiPlayboy">TheDesiPlayboy</a></p>
                    <div class="content"><p>It was a wild Friday night at one of the country’s most notorious party schools. After a round of drinks downtown, my roommate Jay and I hopped onto the shuttle bus that ferried residents of our apartment complex to and from the bar scene. The shuttle was packed with the usual crowd—students looking to squeeze out every last bit of fun from the night. Among them was Isabella, a petite Filipina grad student with a killer body and a playful smile that immediately caught my eye.</p>

<p>You don’t get far by just sitting back and watching. Whether it’s in the bar or on the bus, if you’re not ready to engage, opportunities pass you by. The game doesn’t wait for you to be ready—you have to be ready for the game.</p>

<h1>The Approach and the Cockblock</h1>

<p>As the shuttle rolled down the road, Isabella, sitting by the window, suddenly called out, “You’re handsome!”—loud and clear for everyone to hear. Most guys would freeze or second-guess themselves. Is this really happening? Should I do something? If you have to think about it, you’ve already lost. Confidence comes from preparation, and I knew exactly what to do.</p>

<p>I invited her to switch seats with her roommate, Priya, so she could sit next to me. But of course, Priya wasn’t going to make it easy. She gripped Isabella’s hand, trying to keep her from moving. Classic cock-blocking—Priya was doing everything she could to stop this from happening. On top of that, a fat, drunk guy in the backseat had been harassing her all night. So, she had her hands full, both literally and figuratively.</p>

<p>This is where Jay came in. A good wingman doesn’t just fill space; he knows how to handle business. I sent him over to talk to Priya, knocking out two birds with one stone. First, the fat drunk guy finally stopped harassing her. Second, with Jay keeping Priya busy, she stopped cock-blocking, giving me a clear path to Isabella.</p>

<p>Success in game is calculated. This was textbook: obstacle neutralized, logistics handled, attraction in motion. If you don’t understand this kind of strategy, you’re always going to be stuck wondering why you’re not getting ahead. Master the fundamentals, and success isn’t about luck.</p>

<h1>Building Attraction</h1>

<p>Now that Isabella was next to me, we continued our conversation. She mentioned noticing me before on the campus shuttle, remembering the time I wore a suit. To her, that suit represented status and ambition—a man who knew what he was doing. I didn’t have to explain it was for my first-ever job interview, which I bombed. None of that mattered. What mattered was that in her eyes, I was already high value, and I played into it.</p>

<p>Isabella was several years older than me—an attractive older woman with more maturity and confidence than the girls I was used to. It was all about maintaining my frame and letting her lean into that attraction.</p>

<p>At one point, I could sense things were heading in the right direction, so I tried to push for more. I suggested heading back to her place, and though she seemed interested, Priya had other plans. Right as I was making my move, Priya grabbed Isabella’s hand, pulling her away. Typical cock-block move, but I managed to get Isabella’s number before they left.</p>

<h1>Closing the Gap</h1>

<p>Even though Priya had cut things short, I wasn’t about to let the momentum die. I got back to my apartment and thought, Why not strike while the iron’s hot? So, I gave her a call. The first time—no answer. I tried again, and nothing. I could’ve let it go, but I felt the need to keep the window of opportunity open. Most guys would’ve left it at that, but sometimes persistence pays off. I knew the connection was there; it was just a matter of timing.</p>

<p>After a few calls with no response, doubt started creeping in. Had I pushed too hard? Should I have waited? It felt like the moment might’ve slipped away. I gave it one more shot—and then my phone buzzed. Isabella finally called me back, teasing me a little, asking if I was still up and if I wanted to come over.</p>

<p>I hadn’t overplayed my hand; I’d stayed in the game long enough to win. Persistence and calm under pressure will win every time.</p>

<h1>Sealing the Deal</h1>

<p>When we got back, I met her three roommates. This is where many men feel the pressure or get intimidated by the crowd. Not me. I quickly built rapport with them through humor and casual conversation, putting them—and Isabella—at ease. People can sense when you’re relaxed and in control, and that’s what opens doors.</p>

<p>As the night went on, I suggested to Isabella that she give me a tour of the apartment. That was my way of subtly taking the lead, without being pushy. She agreed, and we eventually found ourselves in her bedroom.</p>

<p>Back in her room, things started to heat up. As I began to undress her, I noticed the lacy, pink thong she was wearing—clearly chosen with intent. Seeing my reaction, Isabella smiled and revealed that one of her American roommates had lent her the thong for the night, just in case something like this happened. It was a subtle nod to the fact that she was fully aware of what she wanted and had prepared for it.</p>

<p>Women know what they’re doing. When you understand that and stop tiptoeing around what they want, things become a lot clearer. Isabella wasn’t just along for the ride. She was in control of her choices, and she made it clear she wanted the night to end this way.</p>

<h1>Technique Breakdown</h1>

<ol>
<li><strong>Mentorship and Wingman Strategy:</strong> Sending Jay to talk to Priya killed two problems at once—the harassment from the drunk guy stopped, and the cock-block was neutralized. A solid wingman understands his role and executes without question.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Control:</strong> Maintaining the image of a high-value man is crucial. She remembered the suit, and that suit signified ambition and confidence. You don’t break that frame by overexplaining or second-guessing.</li>
<li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Knowing that Isabella was my neighbor gave me a logistical advantage. It made the transition to her place seamless, without any unnecessary friction. If logistics are off, everything crumbles.</li>
<li><strong>Social Proof and Rapport:</strong> At the apartment, I immediately built rapport with her roommates. You have to understand that it’s not just about the girl; everyone around her has to feel comfortable with you. If you get them on your side, resistance fades away.</li>
<li><strong>Leading the Interaction:</strong> Suggesting the tour of the apartment wasn’t just small talk. It was a smooth way of guiding the interaction towards escalation without being pushy. If you don’t lead, she won’t follow.</li>
