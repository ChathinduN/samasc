                    <p class="content">When I was traveling in EU and went out here I noticed that white ppl both men (but mostly women) ignore me. Some dudes are okay when I open them but stay standoffish and not really investing in the conversation. As example that I always have to ask the questions and never get questions back.

But when I meet Indian guys (solo and groups) they are very kind to me, asking questions, having conversations about India and giving me beers. I barely had this with white or other Asians.

I’m mixed white asian man born and raised in eu country.

Any explanation because I’m used to be treated badly by most people, essentially during nightlife.</p>
