                    <p class="content">I recently moved to the US for grad school. I have lived abroad in the past, so I don't have issues regarding culture shock and my accent and behavior is fine as well. 

But I am tired of living like a second rate person here. I continuously feel like the only way I can be seen and be treated as equal to a white person is if I get extremely successful in every aspect of life (like earn a huge amount of money, start a company, get jacked af). And this is an immense amount of pressure that I did not feel when I was working in India. Being an Indian person in tech is itself a stigma here (e.g. compared to finance) even though tech itself is a pretty high paying profession.

Like I feel like women of other races (this includes ABCD women, they ignore me as well) wont even respect me as a person unless I reach a peak level of fitness, dress better than everyone else, and "look less like an Indian"). But privileged white men, and even those of other races, are not held to such a high standard. (It's not like I'm a slob, I'm pretty fit, dress well, etc but its not enough). 
Even in class, the only people who actually come up to talk to me are desi guys. Many times I have felt like guys from other races gave me a backhanded compliment or stereotype me.
I can list many cases where I have felt like I'm not being included or accepted. There are exceptions to this ofc, not everyone is bad, but this is the general sentiment.

I remember this time when a couple of us were dancing in a club, and from our group a white guy (pretty average) and an asian guy (pretty average as well) who entered late were able to pull girls so effortlessly, making my efforts over the last 2 hours feel absolutely comical. At the end I went home with nothing as usual, realizing that if it's actually this easy for people like them, I am not even on the same playing field. I think of this every time I get complacent.

Life is hard here - the H1B situation, and the fear of not getting a job if I get laid off (my whole life could literally turn upside down), long working hours, the terrible dating landscape, etc. 

And ofc as an immigrant you aren't as privileged as locals and have to climb so many mountains to get access to the same amount of support and resources. Dating is so bad already when I'm in college, idk what will happen when I start working.

And I don't want to live like one of those desis in the US who only hangs around other indians all the time. That's just living in a bubble. I want to be able to integrate into this society, and that is just so hard. Moving back to India would be like giving up and admitting to myself that white people, ABCDs and other races are better than me, and I couldn't handle the pressure so I dont want to do that either. Also career opportunities are better here. So I am stuck and have to keep moving forward. I try to do better every day, but I am starting to feel continuously miserable and develop bitterness towards the people around me.

This needs to change since it isn't sustainable, I will just get depressed. I know other desis face similar issues since I have discussed with my friends. Most of them are also unsuccessful in dating, or they just date down and have much lower standards than they should, imo. Some people have given up already, others don't think about things so much as me. But I can't ignore what's right in front of me every day. How can I adjust my mindset and find success in life here? </p>
