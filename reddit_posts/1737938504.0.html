                    <div class="content"><p>We were blessed with perfect skin, perfect hair and good facial features, we just aren’t at our full potential due to our ancestors’ generational malnutrition caused by centuries of colonialism.</p>

<p>Caucasian people pay to have darker skin and darker eyebrows but it seems like a lot of them don’t like darker skin when it comes to natural darker skin? It doesn’t make any sense to me lol. We are basically Caucasoids with darker skin. We just have small differences in regard to facial features when compared to Caucasians.</p>

<p>Do you think we struggle in the dating market due to our skin’s colour or due to stereotypes?</p>
