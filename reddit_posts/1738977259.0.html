<p>This guy is "the face of Indian MMA"</p>

<p>Since UFC 312 is in Sydney and thanks to a friend of mine who works in events I had the honour to meet him, a very cool and humble guy </p>

<p>This guy is putting us on the map</p>

<p>Wishing him all the success when I watch him fight tomorrow and many more like him 🔥🙏</p>
