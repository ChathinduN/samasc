                    <p class="content">I go to a mostly black/Spanish college in the northeast USA. We have quite a few Indians (Indians from America and Indians from India). The Indian kids from America treat the Indian fob kids poorly. They try to exclude them from parties, social events, make fun of them, etc. The white, black, and Spanish kids are cool with them if they're westernized other than that they don't pay much attention. Like at a party this weekend, I told this abcd girl to stfu cause she was tryna get the dudes hosting (black dudes) to kick a group of Indian international kids out. Even the black dudes told her "n\*\*ga, wtf are they doing, they ain't bothering no one or being weird let them be shawty." Like I'm dead serious I don't get this beef between Indian Americans and Indian immigrant kids. </p>
