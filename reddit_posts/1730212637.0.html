<p>Just weeks ago a black man made a racist twt about a indian guy with down's syndrome and it went viral , with nearly all comments dehumanizing him (comparing him to a game character that starts with the worst stats etc.) (my post on it was deleted by mods) and now they are making up random bullshit to kang this dude. Same old "if he's ugly he's indian but if he's good looking he has caucasian/latino/black/arab features"</p>

<p>The comment sections would make you lose iq. And let's not even bring up the retarded "caste system" comments (when homie is a telgu bramhin). </p>
