                    <p class="content">I am not Muslim.  I'm part of the South Asian diaspora living outside India.  I don't downplay the conflicts Hindus have with Muslims in India.  I remember my genial grandfather used to complain about very little, but he did bring up issues about Muslims blocking roads etc. for holidays - and that was one of the milder issues he had.  Some seemed valid.

Today, **the conversational 'narrative' is global** due to social media.  In the past, the Hindu majority could push around the Muslim minority with some confidence, as they had the numbers, - in a debate largely restricted to India.

Today, when Indian Hindus condemn Muslims on places like X, **they bring us all into conflict with Muslims and there are 2 billion of them.   Through their actions, they cause us (Indian diaspora) to be resented by a large fraction of the world population.**

The Indian diaspora does not appreciate the needless antagonism of Muslims to our detriment.   Much of SE Asia, the Middle East is Muslim.  Swaths of Africa are Muslim.   Since there are 2 billion Muslims, they are everywhere.

Further, while Hindus could easily win the debate when they far outnumbered Muslims in India.  Today, in a global community, Muslims outnumber Hindus (2 Billion to 1 Billion).   Significantly.   What it means is that **Muslims generally have greater weight in the narrative wars and Indians end up looking like villains**.

X is a good example of this.  Muslims from every country lash out at Indians; and Hindus, despite being used to winning these arguments against Indian Muslims, are overwhelmed.

The perception of Indians worsens when over 25% of the world population holds negative attitudes towards us and can influence others.   I've seen countless profiles in Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa, and even Europe/US rail against Indians.  This distaste applies to all Indians, regardless of where they are.

While Indians in India should obviously prioritize their own interests, there should be some consideration about what impact their words have on the Indian diaspora, which is far more vulnerable than they are, and subject to the effects of their actions and antagonisms.</p>
