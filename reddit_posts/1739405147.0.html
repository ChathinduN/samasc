                    <div class="content"><p>I get it, white people are a common boogeyman within these spaces so whether or not you wanna pay any regard to what a mayo monkey like me has to say is up to you. </p>

<p>I mean this in the most genuine way - Indians have always been some of the nicest and caring people I know. To be honest, growing up in America, I never actually heard much about the typical negative stereotypes you hear about Indians. I didn’t even think of Indians as nerdy or any of the sort - I thought of them as smart, wise, and generally very empathetic people. I’ve got a couple gym bros who are Indian and one of my close buddies who I train BJJ with is Indian and they’re all really respectable dudes. </p>

<p>Now I know how fucking massive India’s population is and how all it takes is a few bad apples to fuel hatred from (stupid) people all around the world and tbh I wish I knew how you could combat that shit. Furthermore, as a white guy in America who has the privilege of being labeled as an individual and not a racial monolith, I cannot fully empathize with what you’ve gone through and I acknowledge that. But what I will say is that throughout life, I’ve realized that pity partying will get you NO WHERE - the opposite, in fact. </p>

<p>My wife is actually Indian and needless to say if anyone ever spewed any racist shit her way, I would intervene. Her family have been nothing short of welcoming and happy for their daughter - I also have to say, yall have some fucking bomb ass food lol and I def have to fight to say no to more food when I’m full sometimes since she seems to fit that aunty stereotype of feeding, and feeding, and feeding but I digress. </p>

<p>I say this because my brother in law and I have become very close. He’s such a good dude and has a great head on his shoulders but he suffers from severe self pity. He knows I’m a lifter and that I train BJJ and he asked me for some advice for lifting, which I more than happily provided him with. When our schedules permit, I’ll ask him to tag along with me to the gym and I’ll help him out. Recently, he was talking about how he’d been on forums online discussing embracing masculinity in south Asian culture and I did a quick google search and found this sub. </p>

<p>Being brown in a foreign country, you’ve obviously seen that no matter what you do you will be othered (to varying degrees). I see the road to repairing your image similar to how so many Americans dealt with being labeled as toxic for embracing even the slightest bit of traditional masculinity; which is to just fucking laugh at them and keep doing you. Racists have their own fucking problems and we all know that the dumbest are usually the most vocal which is why you see so many dumbass racists congregating on social media and targeting south Asians.</p>

<p>(Again, not conflating experiences) as a dude coming from a long line of Irish lineage, my ancestors knew what it was like to be othered and hated (lol fuck England) but we see how that image has changed in the U.S. since then. Even growing up, my dad (grew up in NYC) used to tell me how he was just called a dumb drunk mick and how everyone thought Irish families were ill tempered, violent, criminals, alcoholics, and dumb. Nowadays, we can laugh at that shit bc it’s mostly behind us and I do believe that it will be for you guys too. </p>

<p>It seems to hit me harder now seeing the racist shit thrown your way all over the internet. Legit all of the Indians that I’m close with in my life are fucking awesome people - wife’s family, coworkers, gym buddies, etc. You guys are fuckin smart, you’re hard workers, and a majority of you are chill as fuck. </p>

<p>The truth is, you can’t give these racists a fucking stage to perform their little theatrics in but that’s what happens when you engage with them saying this shit - they’re baiting you and when you take it, you lose. I see this almost every day on social media. </p>

<p>So next time you see some stupid racist shit on social media, fucking laugh at how pathetic they are and just move on and keep doing you. You’re gonna be better off and happier frankly. Don’t let miserable people get to you. I get that it’s not always as easy as that, but that’s pretty much the only thing YOU can do as an individual. </p>

<p>If yall are interested, I’d be happy to share a word doc / write up that I made for my brother in law for bulking up and lifting. Feel free to DM me or comment. </p>
