                    <div class="content"><p>I recently experienced something that hit me in a nasty way. I was talking to this girl I met through an anonymous love letter page at my university. I texted her, “Hey, it's me, the guy who posted the love letter, how you doin’?” She replied, “Hey, thank you for the post, it made my day.” So I thought things were going well and said, “Cool, wanna grab a coffee sometime?” And then… taadaaa ghosted.</p>

<p>The worst part? She was super interested when I was anonymous, but the moment she found out I’m of South Asian descent, she ghosted me.</p>

<p>This has become the disgusting reality? I’m a 19M who came to this country 6 years ago and worked hard to assimilate. I’ve adapted, balanced different worlds, and found my place here. No stereotypical accent, none of that. But it’s crazy how fast people can make assumptions based on where you come from.</p>

<p>It made me realize just how deep these stereotypes run. People judge without ever getting to know you. I’m more than the box someone wants to shove me into because of where my family comes from.</p>

<p>And honestly, this feels like the result of the nasty Western propaganda that’s been pushed into their heads. It’s sad to see how quickly people fall for it and lose sight of what really matters who you are as a person.</p>

<p>This sucks, ghosting sucks, but what sucks even more is knowing that the reason behind it is something so shallow and unfair.</p>

<hr />

<p>If it is this bad for me Imagine how bad it must be for the International students who were literally told distorted history to make them worship the white and western culture.  Imagine generalising an entire diaspora because of the actions of a few. </p>

<p>But the fact that we still are the richest migrant groups that's what matters and that's the reason they might be so insecure of us. Even the social media posts are targeted to dehumanise the Indian subcontinent. </p>

<p>The only way to win is by success.</p>
