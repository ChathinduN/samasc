                    <div class="content"><p>I’m genuinely scared for the next generation of South Asians because too many of you come across as whiny losers.</p>

<p>Yes, South Asian hate exists, even amongst ourselves, but instead of complaining, there are things we can do to combat it.</p>

<p>1️⃣ Physicality – Get Stronger &amp; More Athletic</p>

<p>Hit the gym at least 3 times a week, focusing on full-body workouts (our bodies respond best to this).</p>

<p>Nutrition tip:
    •   Cut your carbs in half every meal.
    •   Increase your protein intake.
    •   If you’re Muslim, incorporate higher-fat meats (we respond better to them) – e.g. lamb, chicken thighs/legs, salmon.</p>

<p>If you’re weak, small, or out of shape – fix it. Your physical presence should command respect.</p>

<p>2️⃣ Looks – Present Yourself Better</p>

<p>Looking good isn’t just genetics, it’s maintenance.</p>

<p>✅ Eyebrows: Trim them, pluck the monobrow (break the stereotype).</p>

<p>✅ Facial Hair:
    •   Clean shave if your beard is weak.
    •   Grow a beard that suits your face shape.</p>

<p>✅ Haircuts: Get a proper fade/haircut twice a month – make sure it actually looks fresh.</p>

<p>✅ Line yourself up at home in between (cheap trimmers + YouTube tutorials).</p>

<p>When you look sharp, you feel sharp.</p>

<p>3️⃣ Hygiene – Fix This ASAP</p>

<p>Some of you need to hear this. We already have a stereotype of smelling bad. Don’t reinforce it.</p>

<p>🚿 Shower daily (minimum)</p>

<pre><code>•   Use proper shower gel (not a 3-in-1 garbage bottle).

•   Shampoo 1-3x a week, condition every other day (prevents breakage).

•   Use a loofah – washing with your hands does NOTHING.
</code></pre>

<p>🛁 Post-Shower Routine
    •   Use separate oils for hair &amp; beard (if applicable).</p>

<pre><code>•   Moisturize (face, ears, nose, and body).

•   Double up on deodorant (Roll-on + Spray).
</code></pre>

<p>If you stink at Jummah or have smelly feet, fix it. People notice.</p>

<p>4️⃣ Intellect – Level Up Your Mind</p>

<p>✅ Education matters. Study, study, study.</p>

<p>✅ Social skills matter. Interact with people, especially women, so you don’t act weird around them.
(Asking your mum to make roti doesn’t count.)</p>

<p>✅ Work on your accent.
I was lucky to grow up in a white area, so I don’t have that South Asian twang, but some of you sound fresh off the boat despite being born in the UK, USA, or Canada.</p>

<pre><code>•   Work on pronunciation – accents affect perception.

•   Let’s be real: our accents aren’t the most attractive.
</code></pre>

<p>✅ Be street smart.</p>

<pre><code>•   Observe South Asian roadmen – take the good aspects (confidence, presence), not the criminality.

•   You should never be an easy target for Goreh or Kaleh.
</code></pre>

<p>✅ Know your history &amp; be ready for racists.</p>

<pre><code>•   If someone tries it, physically and verbally check them.

•   Learn to debate and articulate your points (watch Muslim debaters like M. Hijab).

•   Remember: India made Britain rich while they were throwing urine into the streets.

•   Muslim Moors introduced perfume and bathing to Europe. (Google it if you don’t believe me.)
</code></pre>

<p>5️⃣ Be Proud of Your History</p>

<p>We’re one of the most successful immigrant groups despite facing racism.
✅ Top CEOs.
✅ Highest-earning households.
✅ Warrior traditions – we’re NOT weak.</p>

<p>Look at:
🥇 The Great Gama (wrestling legend)</p>

<p>🥊 Amir Khan, Adam Azim, Hamzah Sheeraz, Nishant Dev</p>

<p>💪 Pehlwani (stone lifting, kabaddi, wrestling)</p>

<p>Embrace your heritage – there’s nothing weak about it.</p>

<p>6️⃣ Clothing – Dress Like a Man, Not a Teenager</p>

<p>✅ Start fresh with these staples:</p>

<p>👕 T-Shirts (High Quality)
    •   2x Black
    •   2x White
    •   2x Coloured</p>

<p>👖 Jeans/Trousers:
    •   2x Black Jeans
    •   2x Light Blue/Grey Jeans
    •   2x Blue Jeans
    •   2x Cargos</p>

<p>🧥 Jackets/Hoodies:
    •   2x Black Hoodie
    •   2x Black Bomber Jacket
    •   2x Leather Jacket
    •   2x Smart Casual Jacket
    •   2x Winter Puffer</p>

<p>👟 Trainers:
    •   1x Black Trainers
    •   1x White Trainers</p>

<p>📌 Keep it clean, mix &amp; match.
📌 Doesn’t need to be designer, just high quality (Zara, H&amp;M, etc.).</p>

<p>7️⃣ Dating – Stop Moving Like a Victim</p>

<p>🚫 Stop taking dad selfies.</p>

<p>✅ Fix your Instagram (Watch Jack Hopkins’ ‘A G’s Guide to Instagram’).</p>

<p>✅ Use the right dating apps: Hinge, Tinder, Dil Mil, Muzz.</p>

<p>✅ Stop being awkward.</p>

<p>✅ First date = Coffee/Chai, NOT an expensive meal.
(Are you her dad?)</p>

<p>8️⃣ Finances – Secure the Bag</p>

<p>💰 Earning power = Respect.</p>

<p>✅ Make good money.
✅ Invest in stock dividends.
✅ Start a business.
✅ Have 6-12 months’ worth of living expenses saved.
✅ Have an emergency fund your wife doesn’t know about (DTA – Don’t Trust Anybody.).</p>

<p>Being broke is a choice in 2024 – level up.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts – No More Weakness</p>

<p>I shouldn’t have to make this post, but too many of you need guidance.</p>

<p>✅ Stop whining like little kuriya.</p>

<p>✅ Change starts with YOU.</p>

<p>A lot of our women look elsewhere because they don’t see us as leaders and protectors anymore.</p>

<p>Our ancestors provided for entire families, protected their own, and moved with strength.
We need to go back to that.</p>

<p>Big Papa, over and out.</p>
