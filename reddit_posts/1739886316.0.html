                    <div class="content"><p>Indians are way too passive and gentle. I was watching a video on tiktok of some white teenagers deciding to do a prank on some random middle aged Indian guy who looked super nerdy and weak at a store where they had one of their homegirls walking with them and one of them slapped the girls ass and they all ran off and she decided to turn around and confront the Indian dude for doing it. The Indian dude kept saying "sorry maam, sorry maam." I commented "bro this dude is embarrassing us by not standing up for himself, imagine those kids doing that to some hood black or Spanish dude or one of those country conservative white dudes, they would have gotten beat up, they knew that brown dude was an easy target so they did it to him." Before I know it, people were saying shit like "so you want unc to go to jail over tryna make himself look tough for beating up some teenagers." and I'm like ofc he shouldn't physically assault them but at least verbally stand up for himself. </p>

<p>When I was a junior in high school and there was a group of hood black kids making fun of Indians on snap. One of the girls were posting "ion date indian n**gas they lame on dead dawgs" and the dudes were making fun of some autistic Indian kid daring him to dance to random drill songs and telling him if he does, certain girls will go out with him.  I was telling our people, we gotta flame ts outta them and stand up for our own people and one of their responses were. "Let's not stoop down to their level, we're Indians, we're educated unlike them, we don't have single moms, gangs, and dropouts." One of the Indian girls said "they're jealous because we rich and educated and we don't live in the hood." </p>

<p>In fact other day I was walking inside a mall and some hispanic kids walked up to me thinking I'm some Indian FOB they could mess with and told me "yo paijeet u tryna get put on my with my hg." and my response was "ion got time for lil kid activities so have a good day." They were shell shocked silenced. </p>

<p>I'm telling you, ppl will stop walking all over us if we stand up for ourselves. Blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and even East Asians do it so why can't we. </p>
