<p>Have we written what your goal is and figured out the daily habits which lead to it being achieved?</p>

<p>Building muscle is painfully hard for everyone and even harder without a plan</p>

<p>Make it a point to put your headphones in every day, fill up your water bottle and head to the gym even if it's the last thing you feel like doing</p>

<p>This daily ritual of preparing for the gym all but guarantees you achieve your fitness goals by breaking your goal of building muscle into the tiny habit of changing into your gym clothes every day</p>

<p>Try it out, let me know how it goes, we're all toughing it out to try reach new and higher goals </p>
