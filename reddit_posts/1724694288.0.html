                    <p class="content">We need to stick togheter in Real life, because  that's the only way to combat real life hate because I know how everyone says punch them in the face or fight back but whats the point ? If there's dozens  of them and only one of you it don't matter if you're jacked and know how to fight, you're not taking all 15 guys without having to resort to lethal violence putting you in the news increasing hate agisnt us, this is why we need to stick together like surround yourself wi th strong,loyal,and most importantly people who know how to fight ,because don't you see we are still falling for the same strategy they used 100 years ago to colonise us "DIVIDE AND CONQUER " all we need need is not even have gangs of friends but atleast like 6 friends that you can trust with your life that they got your back financially,socially,and In fights
