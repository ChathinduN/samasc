                    <div class="content"><p>If you asked me in 2023 if i was happy how i looked, i would've given a no. </p>

<p>I used to have <em>terrible</em> cravings. In 2023 after school id have whole packets of chips, biscuits and sweets. Id delude myself into saying this was 'good' for my bulk but i was only eating this food because i had no self control.</p>

<p>🎙️ "But here’s the truth: overcoming cravings starts with an identity shift. I told myself and made me believe that i am a person who eats for nutrition, and to support my goal</p>

<p>The second thing i needed was not just about willpower, but having a <em>stronger why</em>. When your goal and the reason behind achieving it is bigger than the temptation in front of you, the ‘how’ becomes a lot easier." If i was offered money to put down the oreos, i would've done it alot sooner.</p>

<p>However as south asians your environment doesn’t make it any easier. Maybe your family doesn’t understand why you’re trying to eat clean, and they keep pushing food on you. Here’s what I’ve learned: you don’t <em>have</em> to eat it. Just say, ‘I’m not hungry right now; I’ll eat it later.’ And then... don’t eat it later." It sounds too simple to work but there's nothing making you eat food you don't want to eat. If you want more lessons ive learnt you can binge my channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pullupspaki">Pullupspaki - YouTube</a> </p>

<p>Or if you’re brave enough, you can be upfront and say, ‘This is for my goal.’ But i didn't have the strength to do that at the start of me fixing my eating habits.</p>

<p>It took me so long to realise theirs literally nothing stopping me from eating intentionally for my goal – nothing except my own mindset.</p>
