                    <div class="content"><p>For the longest time I never had a photo and got through 100+ Lyft rides with a 5.0 rating, in a huge diverse metro area.</p>

<p>Always stayed quiet, never bothered the drivers, but if the drivers started small talk with me then I'd politely engage with them. Never smelled bad or slammed doors or made a mess or talked on my phone. In other words my behavior never changed.</p>

<p>But once I uploaded a profile photo of me smiling, my rating tanked to 4.85 and hasn't increased for months.</p>

<p>I'm def not complaining about such a petty issue but can't help but wonder if things would be different had I been black or white.</p>

<p>Literally the only change was the photo. Wondering if seeing a male brown face subconsciously brings out people's inner biases whether they like to admit it or not, especially in a hyperdiverse city.</p>
