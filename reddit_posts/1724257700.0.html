                    <p class="content">Why tf are South Asians/Desis trying to pander to East and South East Asians? I am seeing hella Indians post on r/Asianmasculinity hoping to get accepted just to be met with a barrage of hateful racist comments and being downvoted into oblivion. 

One example: https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/s/ey8E2jxPFU they legit want Indian women to start a civil war in India lol.

The truth is they look down on us. Stop feeling bad for them and stop trying to find similarities in our struggle, we are not the same. They are trying to replace the whites, while we are fighting to be treated as humans.</p>
