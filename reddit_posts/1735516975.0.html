                    <div class="content"><p>I’ll try keep this story rather concise and to the point. Basically, I decided to hit lower abs and went to the dip bar. When I got there, some old 6’3-6’4 guy who looked very similar to the Janitor from Scrubs/Mike from The Middle had his stuff there. I politely asked him if he was using the equipment because he was on the other side of the room doing something else. He basically just gave me a really dirty look and moved his stuff without saying a word. I didn’t think much of it and situated myself at the bar. Right before I was gonna hit my first set, I wanted to change the song playing through my earbuds so I was scrolling through Spotify real quick to find a new one. All of a sudden he comes to me very angrily and proceeds to yell at me and get in my face for the next 30 seconds to get off my phone. I mean I could understand being pissed off if I was on my phone for several minutes and just wasting time, but I was literally on my phone for less than 10 seconds to simply change the song. I was so shocked at the moment, that I was doing and saying everything I could to make sure he was satisfied. My mind was instinctively telling me not to cause anymore trouble. After that fiasco, he stormed out of that area, once again giving me a dirty look, and waited for me to leave. Once I was done, he finally went back to the area and started resuming his workout. I would like to assume that he wasn’t racist and was just a grumpy old man, but considering the fact that I live in town where the majority are MAGA, I have my doubts. However, I don’t know how he interacts with other types of people so there’s no way of me definitively knowing rn. I spent the rest of my workout session thinking about what I should’ve done. Anyways, that was just a vent that I needed to get off my chest. I’ll probably forget about this in a day or two.</p>

<p>I guess my questions for this discussion are:</p>

<p>Did I do the right thing? If not, what should I have done?</p>

<p>Do you think the guy was racist? If so, is it gonna get worse with the rising anti-Indian sentiment and H1-b civil war happening within MAGA?</p>
