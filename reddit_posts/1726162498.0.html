                    <p class="content">I need to get a procedure done to reverse acne scar damage to my face. I've heard the Co2 laser has produced wonders but I've also read that it's not recommended for people with a dark skin tone. I'm worried that I might go to a white doctor who'd proceed with a standard treatment that works for white folks but might not give me good results due to the difference in melanin content.

I'm open to all sorts of recommendations and suggestions.</p>
