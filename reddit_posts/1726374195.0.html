All Desi’s need to be financially literate

I wrote about 4 pillars of desi well-being here

https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/s/RTobFUmPMX

1 of those pillars was financial abundance. Which has a buff/debuff effect on the other pillars depending on how much or how little you have.

Some desi families are actually selling their assets to fund education abroad for their children. 

Lack of money can cause family problems and health problems. 

And a significant amount of desi’s a struggling in this area. 

It may be worth desi’s to find creative avenues of income in addition to traditional methods 

Do any of you have financial problems ? How is it effective your health and relationships?

Has anyone found a creative solution to increase their income what advice would you give other desi’s?

What are your long term plans to improve your financial standing? </p>
