                    <div class="content"><p>Lowkey we deserve this after all the shi we went thru. I remember being Indian in middle school was hell as people would clown and bully us all the time. (im 19 in college right now) but lowkey now being Indian is a lotta fun. Like in my college I'm seeing Indian fobs (some not even good looking) getting play from the baddest white/black/Spanish girls that's how far we've come. But here's what imma tell you, if you not in the gym, you not working on your social skills, you not in the barbershop, if dont got any drip, if you got strict Indian parents and your constantly being a slave to them, the great shift will not apply to you I'm sorry to say. </p>

<p>Only thing I feel is that there will actually be serious competition for brown girls now. We won't be competing with some nerdy below mid ugly white and black dudes who got aspergers who cant pull girls in their race so they go for our girls, we will have to go against Brock the qb of the football team and Jayden the lightskin curly head 6"3 shooting guard that plays varsity basketball and has multiple college offers and Donovan the 6"8 dreadhead darkskin multi sport football and basketball player. I honestly feel it'll be a good thing because it'll wake up the Indian nerds who hold us back to actually improve their looks when they see the woman that their parents arranged for them won't be messing with them no more. </p>

<p>Like lowkey nbs I honestly feel the rise of this great shift or whatever it is because many brown people are waking up and starting to actually care about our image. Also I lowkey feel many brown kids get a glowup in college and lose their v card once they're not under the roof of their parents. Especially I feel brown girls gain confidence too. </p>

<p>Like bruh I cannot tell you how much progress we've made. Every brown kid I see these days plays a sport or is in the gym, I'm seeing brown kids who are in late elementary starting to get into dating, also I feel as our parents become more progressive and American born Indians start having kids all of the negative stereotypes will go away. Whenever I'm at college parties, I see tons of Indians. In fact I went to a frat party back in September, saw an Indian guy with some fob indian uncle was djing too. Whenever I'm at the gym, I see Indians (both abds and fobs). At a party on halloween me and this FOB Indian dude two manned these two lightskin black baddies (he had the curly head I had the girl with edges) and it went actually successful. Like bruh I'm seeing some white, black, latina, asian baddies dating brown dudes. Even brown dudes who look average are getting on them. </p>

<p>Like do yall not realize how far we've come, I remember 3 years ago this sub was a place for people to moan and cry. The best thing yall can do is improve your looks, fashion and social skills and encourage your brown brothers around you to do the same. Help the FOBS that you see assimilate and help them thrive. If you see a brown kid not being allowed to go out and talk to females, help that kid out and take him to parties, bring him around hot girls, etc. Trust me we can make this movement really thrive. </p>
