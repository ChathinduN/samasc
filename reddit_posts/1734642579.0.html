                    <div class="content"><p>I see a lot of discussions on women from various backgrounds, but not so much on East African women specifically. From my experience it seems like such a rare pairing here in England. I’ve only known one person who has EA and SA parents (not sure if her mum or dad is EA)</p>

<p>I guess I want to ask: What’s your experience with East African women? When you talk to your SA male friends are they favourable of EA women? Where you are is it a rare pairing?</p>
