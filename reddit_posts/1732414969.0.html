                    <div class="content"><p>Objectively I'm attractive, I'm 6 ft 1, 200lbs, decent looking face. A lot of Brown women are attracted to me physically </p>

<p>But once they know me, as a person, they're not interested. </p>

<p>I don't portray myself as a typical South Asian guy</p>

<p>I don't like Shisha, I don't drive fast cars, and I sure as hell, I'm not gonna treat any girl like a princess for no goddamn reason</p>

<p>I'm a nerd, I like comic books, I like anime, martial arts, technology </p>

<p>I hate materialistic shit. And if any girl expects me to be a "provider" then I'll just ignore them and pretend they don't even exist</p>

<p>Just by this alone, I'm not cut out for most brown women.</p>

<p>Maybe any of you can relate, but I sure as hell am not changing myself to fit a mould.</p>

<p>If that means I'll die alone, so be it</p>
