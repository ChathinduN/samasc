                    <div class="content"><p>There I said it.</p>

<p>Can't use IG (racist asf comments).</p>

<p>Can't use Xwitter (same thing lol).</p>

<p>Reddit (more or less the same thing haha)</p>

<p>YouTube (Too many blackpillers lol I hate those guys).</p>

<p>TikTok (most likely getting banned soon, but comments here are also judgmental asf and content can be cringe/triggering at times).</p>

<p>What's the solution? lol don't use any social media whatsoever. Just play video games at his point.</p>

<p>I was gaslit into believing that video games are not "manly" etc... But honestly in times like these, the video games will deffo keep you away from doom scrolling and the constant negativity of social media.</p>

<p>I'd say just delete your social media accounts, download your favorite games, play them, and just focus on your career, build muscle, eat well, and live your life.</p>

<p>Do whatever you need to do to guard your mental health.</p>

<p>I think these social media companies ran a psyop to demonize video games so that people use their platforms more instead of playing video games.</p>

<p>I've pretty much boycotted these shitty racist ass social media sites and I just play video games instead now. Instead of scrolling, just play a quick match. It helps. Try it.</p>
