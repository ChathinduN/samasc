                    <div class="content"><p>So after years of back and forth, senate hearings etc the US gov decides to ban TikTok or force it to be American owned. This is due to concerns over its Chinese ownership and potential link to the Chinese gov (CCP) as well as data concerns of its users. Now everybody is flocking to... Xiaohongshu, another app just like TikTok, privately owned by a Chinese company. As you know TikTok was basically the catalyst when it came to the hate against us (street food shit was probably the start), this was in my opinion coordinated. It was so sudden and pushed into everybody's algorithms it actually spilled over into other platforms. Now we have essentially just replaced TikTok with.... TikTok 2.0. What was the point of even banning TikTok now if everybody is just gonna flock to another one of their apps? What disappoints me is how much talent the West has, yet we cannot even create our own platform for short-form brainrot? Why is everybody also unsatisfied with Insta reels? Reels works just fine and is widely popular yet they want to flock to some foreign app that doesn't even have English text yet.</p>
