<p>As an Asian man growing up in the West, I constantly felt boxed in by stereotypes: too small, too quiet, too “unmasculine.” It’s tough to break out of those labels, and for years, I struggled with confidence—especially in dating.</p>

<p>But here’s what I learned: Confidence isn’t about being born a certain way. It’s about building the skills and mindset that allow you to take control of your life. And for me, the key to doing that was <strong>discipline</strong>.</p>

<p>Discipline isn’t about grinding endlessly or forcing yourself to do things you hate. It’s about training your mind to want the things that are good for you. Here are 3 actionable steps that helped me rewire my thinking and transform my life:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Start Small and Be Consistent</strong>: Instead of overwhelming yourself with massive goals, start with small, achievable actions. For example, if you want to improve your social skills, don’t aim to approach 10 women in one night right away. Start by smiling and saying “Hi” to 5 people a day—whether it’s at the grocery store, the gym, or your workplace. Over time, these small steps will build into bigger habits.</li>
<li><strong>Gamify Your Progress</strong>: I’m a data nerd, so I started tracking my actions. Whether it was workouts, social interactions, or even rejections, I recorded them in a notebook or an app. Seeing the numbers improve over time kept me motivated. It turned what used to feel like failure into a game of progress.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Friction</strong>: Set up your environment to make it easy to succeed. For instance, if you’re working on fitness, keep your workout clothes ready the night before or find a gym nearby that’s easy to access. If you want to improve your social skills, pick venues that feel comfortable to you—coffee shops, social clubs, or meetups. By reducing barriers, you’ll naturally stick to your goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Discipline helped me lose 60 lbs, overcome approach anxiety, and even succeed in my career. If you’ve ever felt stuck, start with small changes. Progress doesn’t happen overnight, but with consistency, you’ll see your confidence grow day by day.</p>
