                    <p class="content">Recently a horrible incident from Korea, about people sharing footages of groping , raping their female family members- in most cases underage- on telegram has started to gain traction (obviously not as much as similar news from India of course) .Its called the "new nth room incident" by korean feminists.

 Read this tweet [https://x.com/Voizeofsoul/status/1827623249825734934](https://x.com/Voizeofsoul/status/1827623249825734934) , and it shows the unique problem Indian media and Indian social media has, and why it needs totalitarian, China style control to be actually functional as a national media apparatus. You will have millions of Indians from India upvoting posts about a pre pubescent teen doing sth risque bec he is still immature [https://x.com/tusharsinggh/status/1825832022037684264](https://x.com/tusharsinggh/status/1825832022037684264) , and generalizing it to rape-ify all Indian men. And then literall dystopian stuff like this doesnt even cross 500k views, is definitely not appearing in the feeds of any women (the people comenting in the posts of the korean feminist who got banned after being reported by koreancels [https://x.com/vryjkof/status/1827865887837450721?t=6h6qZQPoLKGIL7H9ailcRg&s=19](https://x.com/vryjkof/status/1827865887837450721?t=6h6qZQPoLKGIL7H9ailcRg&s=19)  and the current feminist who's spreading the news are mostly some leftwing non- racist men, not one women in the comments- compare it to indian rape news tweets). 

So yeah, I don't consider Indian media journalists human (most certainly not the men- the women are obliged to report on female violence issues- but the men....that one viral fake news article from a subhuman Indian incel writng for Times of india comes to mind, titled sth like " Indian men decide to opt out of marriage altogether once spousal rape becomes illegal" and on being confronted by Indian users he said it was "satire".). SO yeah.</p>
