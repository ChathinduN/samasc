                    <div class="content"><p>Okay, things are slowly getting better for us, but we can't let it get to our heads, there's still much more progress to be made. But what I wanted to address was bragging, I don't know about other south asian cultures but I can definitely say bragging is extremely prevalent in Indian culture and the diaspora. I mean hell, reputation is fucking important asf in India, almost to the point where mfs will kill their daughter if they find out she was with a dude who isn't of a certain caste or background, and don't even get me started on arranged marriages. Still, thats another topic, I witnessed it myself too, my mom was talking to another indian woman, and the other woman was bragging about her son doing all these things in school and excelling in stuff. My mom in her head was probably like "stfu", and I guess thats how the cycle continues. Still, we can put an end to this, there is nothing wrong with having success, but there is something wrong with rubbing it on people's faces and boasting about it, and not to mention, it makes you come accross like a douchebag when you do that stuff, like me personally, I get turned off by people who brag about their accomplishments all the time. </p>
