                    <div class="content"><p>Hello everyone, I’m new here, nice to meet you all! I’m British Indian and I’ve joined this subreddit mainly for hearing about others’s dating experiences and most of the dating posts on this subreddit always say something about Eastern European women. I haven’t had much contact with them so I’m just curious, what is it about Eastern European women being open to us? How true is this actually?</p>
