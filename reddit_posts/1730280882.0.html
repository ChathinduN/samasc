                    <div class="content"><p>Always maintained the stand of "politeness should be reciprocated with politeness?"</p>

<p>Usually introduced myself and started conversation with EVERYONE (irrespective of age and gender) and the people who were polite in return was evident and predictable from their age and gender (which can be a discussion for another day).</p>

<p>Minimum polite behaviour includes not turning away when a conversation is started, making sure to convey that they want to be left alone and don't want a conversation (without being rude and being mindful of tone), talking to people in person instead of gossiping about them in their absence etc. To begin with.</p>

<p>I'm not even going to delve into other deeper norms such as being inclusive, greeting, etc.</p>

<p>Do you have some behaviours in mind that should be upheld socially even in case of disagreements provided the person starting the conversation is speaking with manners?</p>
