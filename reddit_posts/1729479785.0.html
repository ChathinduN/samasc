                    <div class="content"><p>Hey y'all so apparently some users on here put a lot of weight on internet <strong>comment sections</strong> and idiotically use them as metrics to gauge desirability of brown guys lol. I think this is <strong>ridiculously</strong> <strong>silly</strong>, but many users site these comment sections as legit ways of judging the social perception of brown guys.</p>

<p>Some guys here get genuinely <strong>triggered</strong> when they see negative comment sections, and become unnecessarily <strong>concerned</strong>. I want to lay those <strong>concerns</strong> to <strong>rest</strong> once and for all with this <strong>mini-series</strong> called "<strong>Thirst</strong> <strong>Trap</strong> <strong>Thursday</strong>", exclusively on this subreddit! This is the first installment of this mini-series where we get to take a look at all the thirsting going on for our <strong>milk</strong> <strong>chocolate male</strong> <strong>models</strong> all over social media.</p>

<p>It is my intention to <strong>bury</strong> all the blackpillers and dommers <strong>6 feet under ground</strong> with this mini-series. <strong>The</strong> <strong>installments</strong> <strong>will resume, until morale improves :)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Enjoy :)</strong></p>

<p>Enough prelude, welcome to our first episode!</p>

<p>This is Shooter Dival played by Ishaan Khatter in Netflix's "The Perfect Couple". Even before this show came out I already kinda saw the thirst for this dude. There are girls on TikTok making whole ass edits of Shooter Dival. Many in this space would agree that this is indeed great representation of brown boys on the big screen. We definitely wanna see more of Ishaan in Hollywood! and it looks like others want to as well... (take a look)</p>
