                    <div class="content"><p>Every time I see a post of an Indian guy/men posting their Dating win, they almost always do not state their Physical Attributes (such as Height,Face,muscle build, Hair) and their environment in which they were raised. </p>

<p>First the environment, it is pretty intuitive to think that your surrounding shapes the way you are, the way you think etc. </p>

<p>Second the Physical attributes;now this is where things starts to become tricky  because generally the guys posting here could be in some way are just conventionally attractive or above average
(Tall, wellbuilt, athletic etc)  which is in fact playing a major role in their dating success which could give Average Indian guys some wrong ideas about how dating works which can be a problem and also if an average Indian guy does get success in dating (which I absolutely believe they can) and if they post that in this sub the average Indian guys could get a lot more insights about dating success by engaging in conversation with each other because it is a conversation between two people who are not so different from each other, one became successful through different means rather than his looks and got a positive result and the average Indian guy could follow his advice regarding things he needs to change. </p>
