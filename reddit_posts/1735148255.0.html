                    <div class="content"><p>Hi, 5’5” 19yr old South Asian guy here. I’m considering getting limb lengthening surgery within the couple years or so. How this works is a surgeon will fracture a person’s femurs and insert a rod into it. This rod can be lengthened 1 mm a day for a total of 80 days, yielding 8 cm (just over 3 inches) of growth. The bone/muscles/nerves can fill in at a rate of 1 mm per day, so you just have a longer femur at the end. The rod is removed when the process is complete. My parents are supportive and are willing to pay for me to have it done in the U.S. (the safest place to get it done).</p>

<p>The reasons I want this are as follows:
1. I believe short men, myself included, are not taken seriously. No matter what positive things I do as a get older, I feel like it will look like I’m compensating for my lack of stature.
2. I’m young, which would mean now is the best time to do it, in terms of my ability to recover. I’ll need to stay at the site of the surgery for 3 months or so for physical therapy, which I could easily do in my upcoming summer breaks. Moreover, I plan on applying to medical school in the future. Gap years are very common in this process, so I could simply tell those around me that I’n traveling elsewhere for a few months 
3. 5’5” to 5’8” is an absolutely insane jump in terns of height percentile. It gets me from 8th to 35th in the U.S. While I wouldn’t be tall, I certainly would be seen as within the norm for a guy, which is all I really want. I feel like at the end of this, I’ll look more masculine and be treated as such.
4. As is said in this subreddit, brown people lack soft power in the U.S. Being 5’5” makes this problem much worse.
5. Beyond the external improve to my image I think 3 inches would yield, I also internally don’t feel like an adult. I think this would fix my self image.
6. Most patients who undergo this procedure report satisfaction with the results in terms of how they’re treated by others afterwards as well as improved self image, which tells me that it probably will truly fix my issues.</p>

<p>Thoughts on doing this?</p>
