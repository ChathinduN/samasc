                    <p class="content">Hi from Singapore guys,

Joined this sub a few weeks ago and am genuinely enjoying all the high quality posts and gaining insights on the ABCD experience in the US, UK, AUS etc. Keep the high quality posts coming in with all the self improvement and brown excellence, but I want to address something that we tend to skip over, **The Desi Tax**.

From what I understand, a Desi male in the West and anywhere else tbh needs a stable job or business, stay groomed, stay on top of the fitness game, social skills and good education etc just to have a foot in the door in dating. I believe this is the Desi Tax where a 9/10 Desi who does all this is perceived the same as a 8/10 black guy or even a 6.5/10 white guy. It almost seems like us Desis need all this extra suave, bells and whistles just to get the same foot in the door as your average white man.

Now of course self improvement is great and the average young male Desi in SG, USA, UK and AUS is doing way ahead of the curve in education and earning power but it seems unfair no? We do all this just to be placed in the same league as a white guy 2 ratings below us (give or take from our observation) even the wacko r/ABCDesis agreed theres some Desi Tax where 8/10 Desis are dating 6/10 other race partners.

Now my question is, will the average Desi man start winning? Will there ever be a point where the average Desi male gets the same standing as the average White male without having to massively improve himself? I did see some threads of UK Asian roadmen getting around with women but seems hilarious imo, we don't need to be roadmen.</p>
