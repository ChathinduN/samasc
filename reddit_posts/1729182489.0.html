                    <p class="content">So I've been noticing how there's been a general rise in anti Desi content online the past few years and it's not even up for debate. Accounts on "X" and Instagram with seemingly insignificant follower counts blow up with millions of likes when making degrading memes of Desis within hours. Also just go through these likes and you'll find out some of these people are genuine losers behind a screen and some are your average Joe who's actually racist and hiding it in real life.

While mentioning the name Joe, I got reminded of a mid show I recently watched on Netflix called "You", now I'm sure most of y'all have heard of it but it's basically about a trashy character named Joe Goldberg who's a creepy stalking murderer who even manages to get married to a character named Love Quinn at one point. Not the issue but could you imagine if the character was portrayed by an Indian instead of a white guy? Instead of 5 seasons it would be cancelled in 5 minutes ðŸ˜‚. I could definitely see someone like Dev Patel as a lead but we all know that won't happen for sometime soon.

The point I'm trying to make is, yes there is anti Desi sentiments particularly dissipated through memes and in general "X" and Instagram but in real life? Barely any. I've noticed pretty much none of my non-Indian friends mention anything of Indians being creepy or smelling bad etc and only had a Pakistani coworker talk about the "DO NOT REDEEM" shit.

Stay woke and don't fall into BS self hating thought processes due to manufactured algorithms as real life is not the internet but do stay woke like I mentioned, there are certainly biases against us, mostly online, may or may not spill into real life but stay vigilant fellas.</p>
