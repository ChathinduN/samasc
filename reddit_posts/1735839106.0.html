                    <div class="content"><p>Before I start talking about it, I would like to tell you all about my past. I have always had anger issues to the point where I almost killed a kid in my school while choking his brother out in a deadlock. I have choked another kid on the school bus for some silly joke. I smacked a girl and spat on her and humiliated her in front of everyone because she tried to throw away my shoes. I have got into various altercations like these where I have done horrendous things. I had severe mental health issues mostly because of the toxic environment that I grew up in. My mom never was present for me and always created havoc at home. </p>

<p>I feel like I might touch this dark side of mine again as an adult. The online hate is getting under my skin. I have vicious thoughts of snapping some white men in two and doing very graphic things to their loved ones in front of them. Going on a rampage and man-hunting people behind the keyboard. I have started seeking therapy. It has been almost 7 to 8 years since these thoughts came back to me. It had all ended in 7th grade but seeing these trolls wants me to do unthinkable. Mind you (not trynna boast) but I am strong like real strong, the average and the above average don’t stand a chance against me. It’s scary to the point that I feel I might lose myself and do some really shady thing. 
Give me tips to deal with these thoughts and emotions </p>
