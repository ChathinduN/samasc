                    <div class="content"><p>Guys I’m 18 years old Indian based in USA I’m graduating high school soon and I honestly need some help. Theirs three things I want to address. Firstly, I really need to gain some weight I am 5’9 and weigh about 115 lbs. I don’t look as skinny like people will think I’m 130 but still I want to put on muscle I have been working out for months but still no progress. I have lot of Indian food at home like mutton,chicken Biryani, and beef haleem, lots of meat and veggies but still I am not gaining weight. But I will admit my appetite is very bad so any way I can increase that? Secondly I can’t talk to girls like it’s bad. Refelctinh ob my self this year I think I have definitely started looking better this year and have noticed girls talking to me more but I really just can’t handle eye contact maybe it’s the corn idk if it is tho. I try to be a good Muslim and get off that stuff but it’s such a bad addiction. Thirdly, and speaking of addictions I have kind of a smoking addiction. I used to smoke a ton of weed but I’ve limited use to Fridays only but it’s not the smoking that’s really the problem. I have had DPDR for the past year and I really don’t know what to do I’m scared it’s not going away. I’ve taken 3-4 months break off weed but still I have that severe brain fog and depersonalization. Plz help thx kinda a rant. </p>
