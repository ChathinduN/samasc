                    <div class="content"><p>Personally, I have none. I'm a 21 y/o dark-skinned, 5'8" Sri-Lankan, and I'm practically invisible to them.</p>

<p>I mean, I don't think my looks or personality have anything to do with it, maybe more with looks if colorism has something to do with it; but I've dated plenty of White girls, Hispanic girls, some Black girls, and even East Asian girls. Hell, lately I've been attracting EA women like crazy ever since I shaved my beard. ü§£</p>

<p>My Indian brothers at my university haven't had much luck either. The general consensus among us is that SA women tend to be really bitchy, arrogant, stuck-up, etc... Honest to God, I'd have better luck rizzing up a basic white sorority girl than a SA girl. </p>

<p>I've been to a few of the ISA (Indian Student Assocation) events on my campus, and it seriously feels like the SA women actively try to avoid SA men, especially at parties and such. There are a few nice ones who will ask who I am (ISA is a very tight-knit community; I only started showing up recently) but it never really goes beyond that. I actually managed to pull a North Indian girl from one of these parties, but you can imagine the total lack of surprise on my face when she ghosted me two days later. ‚ò†Ô∏è</p>

<p>So, what gives? I feel like I might have to accept that I won't be having ethnic kids. </p>
