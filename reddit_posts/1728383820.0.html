                    <p class="content">Hello fellow men of this subreddit, I hope you all are doing amazing. I have been active on this subreddit for a few days and I have come to realize that the entire subreddit is now about dating and girls. Let me be very clear , there is no issue at all in discussing such topics because they are important. However, it feels like we are stuck in a chamber where all that we are discussing is girls. I always questioned my friend whenever he mentioned 

"The greatest tool that can bend a man is the the flower hidden between the legs of a woman." I never took it seriously. I always believed that men are more than sexual creatures however this subreddit is desperately trying to prove me wrong. It is not only this subreddit but the people around me and the rapidly changing culture in our community ( I am from Mumbai, a mainlander). 

I wish we all can discuss more important issues here than just women. Masculinity is a blanket term, it considers a lot of factors and not just women. I hope we all can explore the other tenets of it. I think there are enough subreddits where people can discuss their issues with dating, let us not make this subreddit about dating or what the brown women are doing. The whole point of the ancient India wisdom was to elevate ourselves above the animalistic tendencies.

I hope we all can discuss other topics like our scriptures, diving deeper into improving the image of South Asian community, helping each other with our pursuits, teaching each other on how to mingle with the culture of the countries you all live in while preserving your roots, ignoring the hate which brings in so much negativity which will put us in a loop. 

It is a request to all of you, let women be a part of this sub reddit and not make it the entire gist of it. It feels like gossiping. 

By no means I want to offend anyone, I hope we all take this post as a wake up call to grasp our power back. I think we tend to give too much power to the other gender. </p>
