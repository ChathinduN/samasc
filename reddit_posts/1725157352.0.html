I asked the community what they define as desi excellence. And the community summarised a few main pillars 

Financial Abundance: How are you working towards this goal?(education, promotions, investments)

Social Networking: what quality of people you have around you? (You are the sum of the 5 people you hang around with most)

Health: This area can buff other areas of life so worthy to put attention to this (gym,diet etc). Also mental Health as well, reading psychology.( possibly has negative messages of desi’s effected you in any way and what are some strategies you can use to manage this)  

Inspiration: an interesting point was made that desi’s motivation has been based largely on survival and we as a people have excelled in areas that are largely practical. It is possibly by becoming influential in other areas we can possibly raise a positive profile of desi’s in the west

So what hobbies or passions or crafts have you been Pershing that you geniuinly find interest in?

So how have you been upholding desi  Excellence this last month, and are the things you might like to focus on this month?
