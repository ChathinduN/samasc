                    <div class="content"><p>The redpill movement, had its moments and was usefull at one point to increase the sexual agency of otherwise disaffected  men. </p>

<p>It is now about "holding women accountable" and being "mean to sluts". It is a circle-jerk that devolves into unironic woman hate (sexism is funny, misogyny is just pussy repellent). Even the good girls hate it when 'bad women' are attacked by manosphere types (see nala ray situation). Worse, women are aware of the manosphere and are coded to be hostile to all of its talking points. </p>

<p>Being more open minded, and less 'manospherebro' actually improves your general appeal with the opposite sex. Having fun, not "holding women accountable". <strong>Misogyny arbitrage</strong>. </p>

<p>White men were the biggest benificiaries of "misogyny arbitrarge". Patriarchal societies in asia (where gender roles were crazy), created this appearance of the white man as a libertine guy who is content with occasional sandwiches (as apposed to 'brutal opression'). This is why (imo) mellenial asian women did everything in her power to date outside of her ethnic group. </p>

<p>The manosphere and the revival of traditional christianity on the internet has likely killed this archetype. Whitebros, are now as misogynistic as the rest of us (in the eyes of the modern woman looking to escape 'opressive gender roles'). </p>

<p>This gives you (or any man) the opportunity to capitalize. Be nicer to women. </p>

<ol>
<li>Dont judge a woman for her past (or give that impression you do)</li>
<li>Dont be too rigid in gender roles (you can cook dinner from time to time)</li>
<li>Be quick to laugh, easy to forgive (manosphere bros want you to start fights over re-sheduling dates, completely stupid). </li>
<li>Tease her, dont be confrontational</li>
<li>Be libertine</li>
<li>Fuck her well (this notion that a womans orgasm doesnt matter is gay). </li>
</ol>

<p>This doesnt mean you have to completely let go of any standards. Or marry sluts. It just stop being mean to them.</p>
