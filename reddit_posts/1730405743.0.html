                    <div class="content"><p>I want to start off by saying this is not meant to be offensive or anything, these are just my true thoughts and want to see if others agree/general discussion. </p>

<p>For context; Iâ€™m in my 20s BORN &amp; RAISED in the USA. Iâ€™m 5â€™10, fit, make well into $100k+. Iâ€™m outgoing, coworkers love me blah blah blah. Despite this I get no play on dating apps yet my mid, shorter, less successful white friends have the pick of the litter especially with minority women on dating apps. </p>

<p>I will never date an Indian American woman. These women are the most white worshipping, self hating individuals I know. They want to ride the white cock carousel and then MAYBE get married to a Chadpreet. Even women in my OWN family fuck, date &amp; marry white guys exclusively; Itâ€™s insulting and demeaning. You may say but all minority women prefer white men, well youâ€™re right but Iâ€™m Indian so thatâ€™s my focus. If I was East Asian I probably wouldnâ€™t go for Asian women for the same reason. </p>

<p>Anyone else have similar thoughts? Or is my brain just so traumatized and broken ðŸ¤¡</p>
