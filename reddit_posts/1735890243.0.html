                    <div class="content"><p>Never got to experience dating because I had trouble fitting in. I had a nice middle school experience but in high school and college there weren’t that many desis and the others who were friends with me as expected lost touch with me. Dating was something nobody taught me how to do because in the Indian community it’s a big issue before 25 and I too was not really into all the strings you have to pull and games you have to play for a relationship on top of not being financially and residentially independent. I am 29 now and saved up to buy my own place in the Bay. On paper I’d say I have everything on point: decent looking face, 6 ft tall, slender but not too skinny, high income, plays different sports, financially disciplined, decent hygiene, and has a good understanding of the world events, etc but my social game in terms of charisma and being physical at the right place and right time are things I want to understand more </p>
