<p>Found his reddit posts through a bunch of blk incels making racist commentry on twt. <a href="https://x.com/NarcyTruths_/status/1874543565424263607">https://x.com/NarcyTruths_/status/1874543565424263607</a>  . I personally think he should let go of dating apps and meet women in person .(Although the blk incels do have a point, nyc is easy mode, and he's really good looking, so the 1-2 matches a month makes no sense)</p>
