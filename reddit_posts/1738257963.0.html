                    <div class="content"><p>I see too much bragging coming from our community, especially with the whole we wuzz CEOs and we wuzzz the wealthiest minority saar.</p>

<p>Truth is that no one cares, in the sense that it doesn't really help us be viewed in a positive light. </p>

<p>It just comes off as unnecessary bragging, especially when the economy has become as tough as it is, and so many people are struggling with living costs.</p>

<p>Wignats and racists will view this as 'they're stealing our jobs11!!1!!', and those that don't, will spin it in such a way that we only got their because of being 'White-adjacent' or 'caste privilege', without acknowledging that having an Indian name actually makes it <em>more</em> difficult to get an interview.</p>

<p>To truly move our community forward, we need to be doing more positive things for our countries as a whole.</p>

<p>I have started to give more generous tips, and being more actively conversational with service staff.</p>

<p>This is a small start, but actions like these, help break stereotypes that people have about us e.g. that we are too stingy, and don't assimilate into broader White society.</p>
