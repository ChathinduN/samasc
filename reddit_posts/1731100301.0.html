                    <div class="content"><p>I've noticed an uptick in harmful stereotypes and misinformation targeting Indians, and I'm looking for ways to fight back with credible information, clever memes, and robust fact-checking tactics. I'm not just talking about responding to the outright offensive comments—I'm interested in tackling the subtler stereotypes and misrepresentations too.</p>

<p>I'm looking for:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Solid Sources and Studies</strong> – Reliable research, statistics, and historical facts that can debunk myths about India’s culture, economy, and people. Anything from studies on India's tech industry contributions to insights on its diversity and achievements.</li>
<li><strong>Meme Ideas</strong> – I’ve seen that humor and irony can sometimes work better than just serious responses, so I’d love help with creating or finding memes that counter stereotypes without being aggressive or antagonistic.</li>
<li><strong>Fact-Checking Tips</strong> – What resources or fact-checking techniques do you find best for online debates? I’d love to learn about tools to cross-check info, spot fake news, and address claims with credible sources.</li>
</ol>
