                    <p class="content">So I guess representation does make an impact, but I wouldn't say it isn't an end all be all. You still have to be on top of ur game. Can't rely solely on representation. You have to be well put together on ur own. Just check out this minor effect of decent representation. We need much more like this tbh.
