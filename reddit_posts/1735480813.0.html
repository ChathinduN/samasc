                    <div class="content"><p>Earlier this year, i moved to Thailand (Bangkok specifically) because living in the west was becoming increasing expensive, while my main source of income was online, giving me a bit more freedom in terms of where I live. As soon as I hit my monthly goal and some savings, I went overseas, and haven't regretted my decision at all. I live fairly comfortably for 1/2-1/3 of the price it would cost me in Australia. </p>

<p>Let me tell you guys --I wasn't really expecting to experience any racism here, but it definitely exists. And there are reasons for it existing, especially towards Indian looking men. I will say most are fairly respectful and good people, but I have seen with my own eyes how rude and disrespectful some of the diaspora is over here. Especially towards "working girls" -- often surrounding them and trying to bargain for very little money. This is simply shameful, low class behavior. Others are often loud and try to bargain too hard for literal chump change. And yes, some really do need to take some basic hygiene lessons. BUT, on a more positive note, over the last few months I think there has been quite some improvement in this type of bad behavior. I *feel* that a lot of Indians and people from that part of the world have gotten the message over the last few months. </p>

<p>The outrageous, embarrassing social media posts and comments have surely affected the behavior of Indians in a general manner (RE: gross food vendor videos, the "poojeet" jabs, and smelly Indian rhetoric) . Nobody wants to be degraded this way, especially as a whole. I really think getting clowned like this on the world stage has been negative, but this is a positive that's come out of it. More self awareness never hurt. </p>

<p>Anyway, getting back to my story: There are some nightclubs that will straight up deny entry if you're brown and tell you that you need "reservations" or "bookings", while white people and other Asians are let in with no questions asked. One such example is Route66 in the RCA area, the reviews are full of complaints about this blatant discrimination. But I digress . </p>

<p>This actually made me quite angry to know that there are some places I cannot enter, simply for being brown. Although it is aggravating, there is nothing I can do about it. The tourism authorities don't care, the police don't care, there is no non-discrimination laws here. The only thing that we can do as "South Asians" is LEVEL TF UP. </p>

<p>Listen - I'm not even an Indian, I just look like one as a Malaysian, and my family probably has some Indian ancestry although it hasn't been well tracked. But it doesn't matter here if you're Malaysian, a foreign born Indian in a first world country, or from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or whatever. We are all the same to racists. </p>

<p>All this to say... I have never felt better about myself. I have improved my looks, confidence, social skills, mental/physical health and wealth since pushing myself to train, and take my frustration with "the system" out on the bags and in the ring. </p>

<p>As a result, I often have very attractive women staring at me. I need to develop more confidence to take action and approach these women, but its definitely a good start. It is truly amazing what martial arts has done for me. No amount "meditation", and "practising gratitude " or other self help nonsense will help you as much as doing something challenging as often as possible, that develops you in almost every way as a person too. Obviously, Muay Thai in its country of origin. </p>

<p>Seriously guys, people respect skills. Just dedicate some time every week to hit a boxing gym, kickboxing, or muay thai or atleast some other martial art. And let's be honest - a lot shyness in social skills often comes from a deep fear of conflict. Knowing how to fight gets respect on a deep, somehow "primal" level. Guys have more respect for you, even if they don't know you're a martial artist. This is something I've noticed as my confidence and skill level has gone up for the past year. </p>

<p>As a South Asian, I feel like having hand to hand combat on your "resume" could also be a life saver , especially if rampant anti-Indian sentiment continues growing online. Social networks don't give a single shit that negative/racist content about Indians gets boosted, and comments along with them. Why? Because its entertaining to dunk on India/Indians, and keeps people hooked on the algorithm recommendations. </p>

<p>I am in my 30's now, I WISH I started when I was young. And if I ever get children, this will be one of the first things they will learn from me... how to fight and defend themselves. It's not just about the physical skills, its what you'll learn about yourself, and the confidence you'll get out of it too to handle other parts of life easily. </p>
