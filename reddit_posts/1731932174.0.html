<p>I'm not going to link her other australian indian female friends (what we call "oomf" in gen z lingo) or dozens of other autralian indian women making similar comments. Just curious what australian indian women think in general of aus indian men. Or are they mainland desi women levels of "radfem"(radfem in quotes bec. it's an insult to true radical feminism, they just want to climb over indian men to get accepted by racists of other races).</p>

<p>I mean to be fair , quite a few girls in these tweets are those who were not born in aus, but migrated there a few months ago (esp. the suhana suffer girl, she used to follow me but I blocked her account after reading her latest twts.). So is that a differentiating factor, or aus born ind women are like this too? Lengthy, elaborate answers from aus bros will be appreciated, esp. if they had any positive or negative experiences with aus indian women. I just want to see how it compares with my own experience of us indian women (extremely negative) that I outlined in my post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1g7eso5/indian_women_are_hot_but_the_men_are_hideous_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1g7eso5/indian_women_are_hot_but_the_men_are_hideous_and/</a> (acc. got permabanned because I made a comment abusing a racist ðŸ§ƒ- by using the name of his subgroup, although censored, on the "indians voting for trump" post . u/JarredVestite  lesson learned, you weren't joking man)</p>
