                    <div class="content"><p>When it comes to dating, I'm afraid of humiliation.</p>

<p>By humiliation, I don't mean declines, polite rejections.</p>

<p>It means I'm expected to be "confident" and go for the kiss/hug without asking for consent and making the moment "unromantic" (a couple of women said this and I stopped pursuing them, I just don't care at this point)</p>

<p>This is clearly a recipe for disaster as verbal consent is the best method without any scope for assumptions and supposed to be safe for both parties.</p>

<p>I hooked up once with a woman who gave me clear signals instead of expecting "confident advances" from my side, by touching me all over during the friendly phase and this was enough for me touch her back and both of us escalated. She even openly told about a simp who was pursuing her instead of straight up asking her out verbally. But this was clearly a fling and not meant for long-term.</p>

<p>This whole "consent is unromantic" premise is dangerous and can lead to "MeToo" cases, but who cares you have to be "confident" and "go for it" right?</p>

<p>Also I hate behaving like a simp, have my own life and being humiliated by a woman (anything apart from polite rejections) is the last thing I would want.</p>

<p>Also this is a problem that's exclusive to women in their 20s (they are spoilt for choices, but that's a discussion for another day). Also socializing with a woman in her 20s is the most difficult thing to do. Every other age group is far simpler.</p>

<p>I don't want to bring feminism or other BS ideologies into this discussion. But dating has becoming far more complicated than "polite rejections for polite approaches".</p>

<p>What are your observations?</p>

<p>Note: I don't want any so-called "confident" person saying the same toxic stuff. Keep the discussion constructive.</p>
