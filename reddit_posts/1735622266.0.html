                    <div class="content"><p>I wanted to ask this question because in my experience no brown family or brown girl cared about caste I don’t even know what caste I belong to my parents never spoke about it either and I have alot of brown girls in my area hitting on me but I got shy and didn’t do anything about it but now I’m getting more confident and wanting to date a brown girl ( I dated girls from other races but never brown I don’t hate brown girls it just that’s what happened) so I want ask my fellow brown guys on here do brown girls here in the states care about that shit yes or no? </p>
