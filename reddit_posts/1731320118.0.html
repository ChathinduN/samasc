<p>-> Grew up in Ohio </p>

<p>-> Middle class</p>

<p>-> Went to yale (on merit)</p>

<p>-> Gets married, has kids </p>

<p>-> "Convinces" boomers to take part in an "investment scheme" </p>

<p>-> Makes billions</p>

<p>-> Used cash to buy political influence via podcast/media appearances</p>

<p>-> Went onto the debate stage with the prime objective of defending trump &amp; Trashing Nikki / Desantis (and defending MAGA)</p>

<p>-> DOESNT CHANGE HIS RELIGION/CULTURE TO APPEAL TO REPUBLICANS (Like the vast majority of minorities in politics). </p>

<p>-> Seen by Trump</p>

<p>-> Endorses trump</p>

<p>-> Buys buzfeed (very prudent for a politican)</p>

<p>-> Best friend (who has kids named 'vivek') becomes the VP pick</p>

<p>-> Trump wins, MAGA becomes the dominant political force</p>

<p>-> Becomes a candidate to make electoral decisions for Ohio (the state he grew up in), and one the most influential Indians in america. </p>

<p>-> Loved by right wingers</p>

<p>-> Shapes the political dialectic with high verbal IQ (Trump has changed his position to favor stapling greencards to diplomas)</p>

<p>Be more like Vivek. Partisanship doesnt matter, I welcome a left wing Indian counterpart. This is as much "south asian masculinity" as getting matches on tinder (more important even). You should want our people to excert our will on society and have a hand in shaping it.</p>
