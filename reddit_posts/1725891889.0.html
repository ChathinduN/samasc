                    <p class="content">I wanted to share a video I recently made about something that’s been a game changer for me: embracing a new identity to transform my dating life and overall confidence.

As Asian men, we know how much society stacks against us—whether it’s the media, stereotypes, or just feeling like we don’t “fit” the typical image of masculinity. I used to feel the same way, shy and frustrated by my lack of success with women. But what really shifted things for me was realizing that I could choose a new identity—one that didn’t rely on external validation or those toxic narratives.

I intentionally chose a new identity which helped me establish discipline and consistency in pursuit of my goals. This would help even when I wasn’t feeling good about myself, motivated or energetic in the face of rejections, setbacks and challenges.

So in the video, I talk about how committing to consistency and changing my mindset (and not just in dating, but in life) helped me go from feeling like an outsider to owning my own narrative as an Asian man.

I would also use this mind shift, intentionally choosing my identity as someone who would get a 6 pack after hitting 201 lbs during Covid.

So I thought I’d just sharing what’s worked for me and might resonate with some of you. If you’ve ever struggled with confidence or feeling like you don’t fit the mold society forces on us, this might be worth a watch.
