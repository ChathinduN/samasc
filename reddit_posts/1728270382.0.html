                    <p class="content">I'm 28 and in south FL, and even though my hinge profile gets some attention, its not as much as I would like. It's probalby rough for all races, but being desi just seems like an additional massive handicap at the end of the day even if your career, physique, and grooming are all top notch. How are you all doing with online dating? If you're gonna claim success, you need to post relatively transparent receipts.

Honestly there's way too much focus on average indian guy being unfit, fat, incel, etc that there is little to no focus on an Indian guy who has bettered himself and seeing what sort of tribulations he has to deal with. So then all that apparently matters is just "not being the typical indian guy", while in reality that's well below the bare minimium if you want any kind of decent life as a man. 

Even hamza ahmed never truly posted much in the way of receipts...</p>
