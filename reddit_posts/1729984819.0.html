                    <div class="content"><p>Let’s face it, this world is not a nice place for us brown folks, especially if you live in a western country. Everybody hates us, whether they want to admit it or not, and there’s a saying that goes “Hard times create strong men”. We are going through hard times right now, but it is during hard times where you need to be strong, not even a sliver of weakness shall be seen by the eyes of the enemy. It is extremely important and necessary to keep your cool at all times and stand your ground, don’t start anything, but if they start, NEVER BACK DOWN. Be a man and stand your ground when someone tries to say something or start something. And also, get muscular and jacked, it’s harder to disrespect somebody who’s jacked. And call out any bs that comes out of any chump’s mouth talking bout “you guys don’t use deodorant“ or “you guys stink”, check those motheruckers by asking them to repeat what they said or something like that. Intense eye contact and The bottom line is, stand your ground, because this is gonna get rid of the stereotype that brown folks are weak and will just take shit from everybody, we are starting a new regime around here, no more taking shit from anybody, white, black, green, purple, it doesnt matter, stand your groundm because it is one of the most important qualities as a man.</p>
