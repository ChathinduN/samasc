It doesn't even employ that many people in India after Musk too over.</a></h2>

<p>And one thing that I noticed is that a great amount of engagement is actually coming from <em>Indian</em> engagement farming bots. I remember a post by a japanese account some time ago where he raised this issue , asking Indian users to only comment on thier own (local) posts, becuase in case of emergencies like earthquakes or floods Indian bots would push down highly relevant disaster management posts - the entire thread was by a japanese user with a "japanese indian dost " sth username (likely part of some Indian - jap cultural exchange programme), and in pure hindi .This isn't the actual tweet , but shows japanese users raising this concern <a href="https://twitter.com/safrie10969/status/1828873946898563534">https://twitter.com/safrie10969/status/1828873946898563534</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AoToHime2/status/1843875188385214700">https://twitter.com/AoToHime2/status/1843875188385214700</a> ) . Somebody , preferably a mainlander, link that "dost" japanese user's post if you find it.</p>

<p>(Note, bot account =/= human run bot account. There is a difference. These Indian accounts are "Indian person run bot accounts", made to farm engagement. You'll occasioanlly see them engage in discussions with certain comments, or like some pro- indian, or indian - infrastructure development related posts. So it's an actual person , running a bot that vomits content 24/ 7)</p>

<p>You can see the same in many wholesome/meme posts (there are many out-of-india accounts that only post those type of harmless stuff) that go viral. Indian run bot accounts are outdoing even Only Fans girls when it comes to spamming replies and trying to get engagement. Same for the tweet I linked, where seemingly international/ global accounts (eg the global statistics one) are all Indian . ANd the remaining percentage of engagement comes from large swathes of Indians trying to troll racists. (So one racist comment will get dozens upon dozens of pro indian replies , with those replies sometimes getting a anti indian reply , and the secondary reply will get 4- 5 replies from Indians , ad infinitum). Why is India so pathetic when it comes to protecting it's reputation or fighting the perspective war? Like Indians literally do not give a fuck as long they are able to make elon bucks from tweets that they want to make viral by any means. Pure britsh raj era behavior.</p>
