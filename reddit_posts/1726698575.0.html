                    <p class="content">*Moving to the U.S. as an Indian man* has been a mix of excitement and challenges. On one side, you’re trying to adapt to a new lifestyle, and on the other, there’s the pressure of living up to family expectations from back home. I’ve personally felt overwhelmed at times, trying to manage everything on my own—especially when you don’t have the same support system you’re used to in India.

**For me, it wasn’t just the practical side of life that was tough—it was the emotional distance too.** Being away from family, feeling disconnected, and still trying to meet their expectations really took a toll. It made me realize how easy it is to lose yourself while balancing both worlds.

*I wanted to share this because I know a lot of us might be in the same boat.* How have you been handling things since moving here? **What has your experience been like** with managing life in the U.S. and the expectations from home? Let’s have an honest conversation.</p>
