                    <div class="content"><p>Remember, that's where the brits started colonizing everything. Divide and rule will be attempted again.</p>

<p>Remember the guy who visited India and started trashing it? He specifically hyped up Kolkata. Cogito made an hour long series on the Bengalis. Combined with a bunch of other things that all happened at the same time, its clear that people are paying attention.</p>

<p>In a post-globalized world, Kolkata and Bengal will become a major hub for all sorts of things again. Lots of business happening there. And people are preparing.</p>

<p>The whole business of the US wanting to set up a military base in Bangladesh - its complete BS. India made that whole thing up to generate paranoia and hypervigilance about the US in that region. And it convinced the US to play along with all that BS and pretend it does want a military base there. I thought it was just standard Modi brainrot, but now I know the actual reason why it's doing that.</p>
