                    <div class="content"><p>Need some advice. What does it mean if a girl keeps texting me (like, she’s the one messaging first and even double texting if I don’t reply) but she’s super dry and boring? It’s always stuff like ‘how’s your day’ or ‘what are you up to,’ and she doesn’t match my vibe at all when it comes to banter or sarcasm. It feels like I’m the one putting in all the effort.</p>

<p>We went on a date, and it was actually a lot of fun, but now I can’t tell if she’s not into me or if she’s just really boring. If she’s not interested, why is she still texting me?</p>
