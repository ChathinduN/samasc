                    <p class="content">I remember back in high school, there were so many desi guys who were trying to become valedictorians in order to increase the odds of getting into the ivy leagues. They would put in unreasonable amounts of effort in their studies to make it happen. I’m talking literally studying 12-16 hours a day. 

Desi guys should strive to be valedictorians in fashion and fitness. What I mean is, approach having an amazing physique and having amazing fashion with the same unreasonable effort that you put towards your studies ( it’s also way less effort than studying). Imagine the positive halo effect, if all desi guys strived to max their physique and fashion like they do to max their SAT scores lmao, the image of desi guys would change. 

The desi community is a competitive one, so I can see a situation whereby desi guys start hitting the gym and maxing out their fashion to out compete one another. Remember healthy competition is always good. To prove my point, I did some research. The first Indian American to win the spelling Bee was Balu natarajan in 1985. Ever since then, Indian Americans have dominated the spelling Bee. Why can’t we take that competitive nature and channel it towards something like physique and fashion? If actually executed upon, we could be known as the race with the best physique and best fashion in America within one generation ( especially as more and more Americans become obese).  

Remember, be the change you want to see and hopefully you inspire other desis to take  action. Understand the power of the concept of the butterfly effect. The butterfly effect, basically implies that a small action can lead to great consequences down the line. For example, one desi guy might be inspired by your transformation and choose to transform himself, inspired by that persons transformation other desi guys might choose to transform as well which creates a chain reaction/domino effect and this domino growth is exponential growth no linear growth thus the impact is greater. Remember, many people in our community, just need inspiration to get them going</p>
