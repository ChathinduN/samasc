                    <div class="content"><p>Elon musk, is the biggest contributor to Indian hate. Man has set twitters ( I’m not calling it X lol) algorithm in a way whereby any negative coverage concerning Indians or India gets amplified. He doesn’t pull this shit with the Chinese because he knows it will affect his business. If the modi government were to simply threaten him from banning his products in India for being anti India he would change his tune. High key the modi government is cucked. Indians get hate online but we in the diaspora get the hate in real life smh.  My advice still stands, focus on self improvement and do the best you can , but as I’ve mentioned in the past soft power matters a lot.  Especially y’all youngins, who are coming of age will have to work harder. I’m sorry but the macro environment for Indians is not good. </p>

<p>Y’all can still win if you put enough effort into self improvement, however be prepared for back handed compliments like “ oh your really attractive for an Indian guy” “ I would’ve nvr guessed you were Indian” . Remember my previous post concerning the evidence board… even amongst this shit storm of shitty  rep  there are still desi guys who are winning so don’t lose hope.</p>
