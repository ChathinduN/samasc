                    <p class="content">Disclaimer what I’m about to talk about only applies to American desis(idk how it is in other counties). I’ll explain my thought process feel free to disagree in the comments and provide reasons 

COPE
. I see ppl one here complaining and whining all the time about how we apparently have it so bad when it comes to dating in the west but I literally think it’s the opposite from what I see

LOCATION
. The hottest girls you want to be going for live in the best most happening places in America such as Dallas Huston SoCal Florida nyc nj atl etc etc. All places like this have huge desi populations of second and third gen brown boys so most girls from these places have good experiences with desis and usually have desi friends etc so the idea of someone loosing interest in you after finding out your Indian is alien to ppl who grow up here.

OUR SURROUNDINGS
. Once again the girls who are the hottest and highest quality all end up going to university. Most of the popular colleges have very big desi populations and most brown boys there are into stuff like greek life etc and have no problem at all pulling women of all ethnicities. This again adds to my point on how the women u should actually want are exposed to desis who represent us well. So if u do get girls who loose interest after finding out your indian(if it wasn’t visibly obvious in the first place) they are likely from bumfuck nowhere or are low quality women who don’t go to college and just fade away eventually or likely both. You should have some standards and not even go for those typa women in the first place.

(If you don’t believe me just go to speak random college chicks ig on your explore page and search up “Patel” in her following list lol)


WE HAVE IT BETTER THAN THE MAJORITY OF RACES BESIDES WHITE AND BLACK
. First I’ll talk about how we have it better then I’ll tell you my observations. 

.First of all a lot of brown boys who grow up here with a proper diet etc grow to be 6 foot plus etc that plus that fact that we are the highest earning ethnic group and the fact that the majority of us go to college and get high paying jobs puts us ahead of the rest. Like for many ethnicities going to college in the first place is a huge achievement but for us if u don’t go to an ivy your considered a failure(the pressure is good ig)

. Now lest break down the types of women we get

1. White girls : I see tons of desis with white chicks in college and in the big cities and even at high school prom and stuff. No other ethnicity besides white and black does this. East Asian dudes I never see with them Hispanic dudes I never see with them Arab dudes I never see with them (and I’m talking about the type of girls I mentioned above the typical upper middle class sorority chick not the tatted up gutter bunnies)

2. East Asian girls: once again I besides Asian and white dudes in this case desis pull the most East Asian girls . We usually live in the same places and our parents have the same values etc so we can relate we also take part in common things like kumon deca etc growing up and also are constantly around each other in college. It’s very rare that I see a black Hispanic or Arab guy with abg.

3. Latinas: Latinas usually get with all races and all you really need is to have money lol and we have the most of it. I don’t really see too many desi guys with Latinas probably due to the fact that we aren’t around each other alot(as I mentioned before with the college thing etc). But I think it should be pretty easy to pull one if ur successful and put together

4. Brown girls: I don’t even have to say anything for this one they love us

5. Arab girls: ok so with Arab girls I think we don’t do well at all usually because they have a weird superiority complex and also most aren’t compatible due to religious differences etc so I wouldn’t sweat this too much


Basically as a brown boy in America most gen z guys have are equipped with everything they need (rich tall educated) inorder to pull a hot bombshell


NAME ONE ETHNICITY THAT DOES BETYER THAN US BESIDES BALCK/WHITE

Black: do well with women of all races due to their media representation culture etc

White: they are the majority and are seen as high class etc so they do well

East Asian : they probably do the worst of all the races I’ve very rarely seen them date interracially and they also struggle to get their own women sometimes due to them going for white guys etc. I don’t know why this is because they like us are also educated and rich

Hispanic/Latino: yes they pull Latinas but that’s about it. They also are usually short and unsuccessful which puts the high quality women off limits for them. 

Arab: in the us they are pretty irrelevant and have no media representation what so ever and also aren’t a big diaspora here like we are. Yes they pull Arab girls but i don’t see them with girls of other ethnicities ever.


MAIN POINT: 
brown guys in America are literally at the top and it’s only up from here we’re rich tall smart and educated and pull the highest quality women imwf is very common and besides black dudes and white dudes we pull the most so I don’t know what the ppl in here are talking about.


CONCLUSION:
If you’ve read everything and disagree with a certain point write about it in the comments and provide reasoning

Also I wanna see if there’s people who touch grass on here who are lurking and agree with what I just said. If so please write about it and share your observations in the comments so I know I’m not crazy</p>
