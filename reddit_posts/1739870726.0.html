                    <div class="content"><p>So many of these "Save Europe" X/IG accounts which have become really popular have actually been exposed to be ran by Indians. Don't be fooled into thinking that Europe is having some kind of mass civilian unrest and are gonna deport non-whites back to where we came from (See the 2024 French election). It's a good example of how a very vocal minority makes themselves seem like the majority. I think in this increasingly polarising world both are far left and right are guilty of this.  I have been to Europe and I had a great experience and met many friendly people. </p>

<p>I find it hilarious actually that the far-right thought they were gaining traction then they realised that their own movement had been deeply infiltrated by Indians. Not sure why these guys run those accounts but it's pretty funny nevertheless. Desis have learned how to fuck with Western politics. In Germany the far right (AFD) leader is actually a lesbian married to a Sri Lankan woman which I found pretty interesting, these guys can never escape us 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. </p>

<p>This also, however shows the importance of being represented in every position on the political spectrum, from the left to the right, a concept that ABCuck people do not understand. Am I far left? No, but I like seeing one of us there. Am I far right? No. But it's ideal that one of us is there, since the AFD leaders wife is Sri Lankan, she will at least have some influence over the party and the members of the party will at least have a bit more respect for us (their main target is actually MENA people not us). I research politics heavily and I can confirm that the US, Canada, England, Scotland, Australia, New Zealand, France, Portugal and many more have significant amounts of desi politicians across both the left and right. Although the US one is the one that is mainly important, we could definitely see some improvement over there. </p>
