                    <div class="content"><p>I run a small but growing Discord community focused on fitness, diet, and breaking free from the skinny fat struggle. Most of us are South Asian guys, and let’s be real—this body type seems to hit our community hard. We're all about sharing what actually <em>works</em> to build muscle, burn fat, and ditch that "skinny fat" look for good.</p>

<p>So, I want to hear from you:<br />
<strong>What’s your biggest barrier to getting in shape?</strong> Is it work stress, finances, time, family commitments—or something else? (And please, no one say <em>genetics</em>)</p>

<p>I think it's very important you can actually state what the barrier is so you can actually confront it <em>for</em> what it is, a problem with a name and a solution and not some shapeless formless monster that won't let you pass this bridge out of skinny fat.</p>
