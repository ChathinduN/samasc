                    <div class="content"><p>Have a general idea of what you'll eat for each meal.</p>

<p>For example, I know that for breakfast, I'll have yogurt with granola. For lunch, I’ll make fried eggs, and for dinner, I’ll usually have whatever my mom cooks.</p>

<p>For snacks, I’ll have fruit, dates dipped in peanut butter, or even ice blocks since it’s pretty hot right now.</p>

<p>Yes, this is essentially just having a meal plan, but even a rough plan has made a huge difference for me.</p>

<p>It eliminates indecision, which is often a major reason i find myself eating junk food. Plus, having three satisfying, healthier meals throughout the day helps curb cravings and keeps you fuller, so even if you do have junk food, you’re less likely to eat too much of it. If your curious about more tips ive learnt, i talk about this stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pullupspaki">Pullupspaki - YouTube</a>. </p>

<p>Right now, take a few minutes to map out a rough plan for what you’ll eat tomorrow. Start by sticking to it for just one meal and let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>TLDR: You got a pretty easy way of making a massive difference to your eating habits through replacing one meal with a healthier option and progressively overloading this up to 3 meals</p>
