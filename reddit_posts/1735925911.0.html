                    <div class="content"><p>This guy is being pigeonholed into being a regional rap star instead of an international / american one. The same shit happened to this other rapper, Raja Kumari, who had a song blow up years and years ago and she left her label and continued her career in show business in India because 90% of her fans were from there anyway.</p>

<p>Hanumankind has that same problem. Netflix posted his song onto the Netflix India channel instead of the main one because they know that nobody outside of India really gaf about him.</p>

<p>If i were him, I would argue with Defjam India (his label) and continue to release music that works with an American audience. When you release rap music for an american audience, Indian rap fans will listen anyway (eg. ye, travis scott, and especially carti because every 13 year old in delhi can't stop riding his dick nonstop). He definitely won't make money as fast this way, but its best for his career long term. </p>
