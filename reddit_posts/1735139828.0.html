                    <div class="content"><p>Just went through a break up and it is rough to accept it. But there was no alternative, the relationship had to end even though it almost lasted for 2 years.</p>

<p>I feel I have no game. I don't know how I should approach women. I only had this one relationship and it never got to sex. So in that sense I'm a noob.</p>

<p>Looking for advice on what to do and how to improve. I'm reasonably in shape but on the thin side.</p>

<p>BTW, I'm 25 years old, Indian studying in the U.S.</p>
