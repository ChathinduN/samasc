                    <div class="content"><p>There's a huge debate on X rn between the tech bro right and MAGA base. The maga base is showing it's ugly colours while going after HB1 immigration and indians</p>

<p>However what surprised me is that Elon of all people is outright defending the HB1 program and defending indians. He's explicitly saying that americans aren't good enough to fill engineering spots and that the US must take on indians and chinese to succeed</p>

<p>He also outright laughed at people who wanted to cancel the twitter engineer who was mocking triggered white people and mocked that jlippincott_ user</p>

<p>He's lost a bunch of support from white racists but it is nice to see him defend indians</p>

<p>He is cringe in other aspects but I have to say I'm surprised by this</p>
