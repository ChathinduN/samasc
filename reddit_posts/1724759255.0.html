                    <p class="content">I’ve been slowly cutting off people who make comments about my ethnicity I have friends from other ethnicities that respect me. But for example someone a was hanging out with was making snide comments which in the past I would have laughed off. But now I’m learning more about the increasing demonisation of desi male. And the conditioned passiveness we get ingrained into us. He probably was just kidding but it’s important to be very careful with people you surround d yourself with 

My reasoning for this drastic approach now is from a book called ‘fear of black consciousness’ which is written by an African American author but some teachings can be applied for other ethnicities. 

People who you are interacting with are also teaching you about you. So if you hang around people who respect you, you are more likely to respect yourself.
