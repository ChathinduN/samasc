                    <div class="content"><p>I’m a 23 YO south Asian male. I have posted on here before about an identity crisis I struggle with. Long story short, I don’t feel white enough to be “accepted” into those social circles with mostly white people, and I don’t feel brown enough to be “accepted” into those social circles, and I kinda just feel like an outcast. </p>

<p>This issue has permeated into my dating life. One thing I’ve realized is that I simply cannot connect with white women, or any girls which is outside of south Asian. I have gone on dates 
with them, but just whenever we talk about life experiences we never shared the same type of life growing up. Her childhood was doing a bunch of adventurous stuff, going hiking, ski trips, camping, my childhood was going to trips to India to see extended family. The Indian experience is something that we just do t share, and it makes it hard to date outside my race because of this. </p>

<p>I’ve tried dating other cultures, but not many. Maybe I need to explore more. But outside of Indian girls, it’s mostly been white girls. Issue with Indian girls is many of them find out how white washed I am and then that’s too much of a cultural difference for them.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve just had a hard time wondering where I truly fit in this world </p>
