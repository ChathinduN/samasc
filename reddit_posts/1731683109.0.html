                    <div class="content"><p>Seems like most of you guys are US/UK based so I thought I would give some perspective from the land down under. If I am being honest its not looking too good right now if your a FOB but there definitely is gold to be found if you play it right.</p>

<p>My stats are in my bio (this is very important as everybody's experience will be different based on this)\</p>

<p>Also note that I am a Christian and have a Christian first and last name</p>

<p>Our country has a lot of international students and a good chunk are Indian, we are in a very similar situation to Canada when it comes to universities, uber and service jobs etc. The perception of desi males here is quite bad due to this mostly, but also due to other bullshit such as American media and all the other stupid stereotypes we face. </p>

<p>However, I do not let this get in my way. Australia is quite a nice country to live in if your assimilated and know a few people. I would say I am quite good looking (not to brag), had a hot teacher hit on me from yr 11-yr 12, my mates work for clubs so I can get tables and bottles every weekend if I want to. I usually pull and have met plenty of great women. My most notable experiences were with a Russian and Polish chick I met at a nightclub. Generally I avoid talking about my background because I am born here and identify with Aussie culture, but they brought up the topic of my ethnicity. I told them I was Indian and they found that cool, one of them had been to India (Goa &amp; Kerala) and the other really wanted to go. I asked them what they found so fascinating about India and they said the food, culture and elephant rides. I met 2 great open-minded women who enjoyed travelling and we had a great discussion about India and travel etc. You will notice that the travel types are usually the friendliest. People who explore the world rather than being chronically online at home are much more accepting and do not follow stereotypes because they develop proper experiences and critical thinking. The Polish one will have to wait a bit for the elephant riding but until then she's riding me. </p>

<p>If your a FOB, its not over. I know FOB dudes who are RAKING IN matches on dating apps. Its all about presentation. Level up your IG game, every time you travel get some good snaps of yourself. Your IG is to basically sell yourself as a product. You need great pics. I have invested a lot of money in my image, I have a $6000 camera setup for my IG but for most of you a DSLR should be fine. </p>

<p>I live in Sydney which is a very nice city. The only issue is its kind of ethnically segregated. You have Chinese in their own suburbs, Viets in their own, Indians in their own, Lebanese in their own, Anglos in their own and you get the idea. You'll also see this with Greeks, Aboriginals, Filipinos and more. This means that you need to venture out and build a proper network of people. Biggest mistake FOBs make is sticking to their own groups, and this will not take you far in Australia. One of our communities biggest criticisms is our insularity. Do not be like this.</p>

<p>I am open to meeting some fellow Aussie Desi bros, looking to empower our diaspora and build a strong network.</p>
