The Indian dudes in question are creepy and retarded, but genuinely tell me you haven't seen guy's of other races make rape threats against women/ celebrities they are pissed at ? We all know about the comments female singers get when they cross the age of 18 (the most famous eg. Billie Ellish. Recently a pic of greta thunberg with her chest sticking out went viral on twitter and the comments by dudes were absolutely degenerate). Recently there was a viral case of a black OF teen getting a disease because of a black dude who didn't inform her and was a "serial burner" (burner being ghetto slang for men who intentionally give diseases to women) of vulnerable teens , and the comments on her complaint regarding the guy  ,and various followup posts embedding her tweet were Noah get the boat material.

Not to mention that while moth\*fkr , s\*ut and the like are not only not considered abuses in english, but are now actually part of Gen z lingo (women complimenting men by saying how slutty he looks, etc). But for Indians, trying to translate the hindi variants of these abuses (since most of these guys are dehati's with poor grasp of english) makes it sound far worse.

I follow a girl from delhi whose one of my close friends (she's a mainlander unlike me) and her timeline was how these posts appeared on my feed.

Was dissapointed with her comments, but slightly surprised too bec she has a really good looking Indian bf she loves to death. SO yeah, just wanted to vent a bit, bec this is basically the only safe , non cucked space for desi men, or more specifically Indian men (these days it's becoming more and more difficult for me to use the brown/ desi moniker bec all of this hate is primarily directed at indian/ indian origin men, not other south asians- and them being "mistaken" as an Indian is a completely different thing than people pinning crowded roof train videos or leering videos from neighboring SA countries on India, which has a completely electrified rail system )</p>
