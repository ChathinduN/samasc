Why does it always seem like the guys with the least going on upstairs have the most going on with women?

As an Asian guy and former aerospace engineer, I’ve had to confront my own tendency to overthink, overanalyze, and fall victim to analysis paralysis—especially when it comes to dating. Our brains, sharp as they may be in academic or career settings, can be a huge disadvantage in the dating world if we let them get in the way. But here’s the kicker: it’s not about shutting off your brain, it’s about rewiring how you handle fear, hesitation, and self-doubt.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

• How “smart” vs. “less smart” guys handle dating situations differently: The guys you see winning with women aren’t necessarily smarter; they’re just better at managing their internal dialogue. They don’t let fear of rejection or the need for perfection hold them back.

• Action beats analysis: In dating, just like in any social interaction, overthinking kills the vibe. The guys who take action—even when they don’t have a perfect game plan—end up learning more, gaining confidence, and eventually winning.

• Strategies to break free from overthinking: I’ve had to teach myself how to turn my mind from an obstacle into an asset. There are real, practical steps you can take to break free from the over-analysis trap and start seeing results, both in dating and other areas of life.

I know firsthand that, as Asian men, we often carry the burden of being “perfect” or doing things the “right” way. But sometimes, a simpler approach—focused on action and being present—leads to better outcomes when approaching women.
