                    <div class="content"><p>I will start this post with a personal story: a few years ago I moved from a smaller European city to a bigger European city. At this point I didnt even know one person in this city and I was trying to build a social circle and meet new people.</p>

<p>I met this guy who had also just moved here and same age, same career as me. We got along so we started to hangout and both of us were trying to improve our dating life and meet more women.</p>

<p>I personally have always been a cocky mf full of confidence and good with women while this guy I am talking about is more of an introvert.</p>

<p>And now after a few years I have build myself a social life of abundance, I have a list of invites every weekend like house parties, drinks, clubbing and whatnot and I can pick whatever I feel like doing and I meet women authentically in these situations, I have a rotation of women I have sex with and I think I have done well in terms of social status.</p>

<p>And throughout this time I was also continuously trying to help this guy with his dating life, I would take him with me as +1 to parties all the time so he gets to meet more women and he also put in a lot of effort trying to improve himself but regardless he just couldn’t do well. There were even times when he got seriously depressed from the situation and started having mental issues, specially seeing me and how I would be leaving the party with some girl back to mine pretty often.</p>

<p>Sorry if I sound like a doomer but maybe some guys just dont have it and that’s perfectly okay. Do not attach your self worth to this stuff. Give it a try for sometime and if you are not getting the results just move on to the next thing otherwise you will waste a lot of time which you could have been used to do something else.</p>

<p>In my opinion if you are a young guy in your early twenties, then consider this stuff as a phase and try to sleep with as many women as possible, once you have a  high body count you would automatically get over this bullshit and if you are not getting the results, just move to the next thing and believe me, you are not missing. </p>

<p>As a man there is a lot of stuff you can find validation from, building a product, building a nice physique, making money or whatever but do not look for validation from other people specially not from women.</p>

<p>Thats all for today and now I will be back on my bender xx</p>
