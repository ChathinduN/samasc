                    <div class="content"><p>It's insane that when a person from our community does something, it's the entire community. </p>

<p>But any other community and you should look at them as individuals. Except for the Hispanics who are also being scapegoated. </p>

<p>Most Indians, if not all, did not go right wing for prejudicial reasons and to screw over some other community. It was for financial/economic reasons. You can disagree with them putting money first but the narrative that it's because they despise certain communities, is complete bull. </p>

<p>It's extremely hypocritical that after they created that narrative, that they decide to negatively stereotype everyone from our community. At least have integrity in your views. </p>

<p>If you want to be prejudicial, at least don't be hypocritical about it. Bad if we stereotype them. Good if they stereotype us. If these are YOUR standards, stand by them. </p>
