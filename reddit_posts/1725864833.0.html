                    <p class="content">I'm an Australian born desi, and I generally find that most "racist" sentiments I experience from the Anglo-Australian majority is a form of mate guarding. European-Australians (Italians, Greeks, etc.) don't seem to care all that much.

Openly being racist to a minority isn't that common here, but I've noticed a slight uptick in shitty racial comments when around girls, sometimes from people that are otherwise chill and likeable.

I'm not a casual hookup kinda person, plus I reckon brown/med girls are the cutest so I don't usually go for Anglo whites (they come to me lol). I usually just laugh it off cause I honestly don't really care. But the implication is they want to root everyone else's women but don't want anyone to root theirs, so I feel like some (light-hearted) clap-backs and rubbing their face in it is in order.

Anyone have experience dealing with mate guarding in white social circles?

Sidenote: I honestly don't care if Anglo-Australian dudes marry brown girls. Their gender war mate-guarding shit is a part of their culture we should try not to emulate.</p>
