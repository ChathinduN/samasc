                    <div class="content"><p>Sarcastically I'm supporting this Brown hate by all other races like White , Black, Latin , Asian and Arab. </p>

<p>Their racism is uniting our brown people. </p>

<p>Either you are a Pakistani, Bangladeshi , Sri Lankan, Maldivian , Indian , Nepali or even Afghani all other race calls us Indian and mocks us in real life or racially attacks us on the internet. </p>

<p>Keep doing it . It is making us united. </p>

<p>"Unity is strength"</p>

<p>I heard stories from the Pakistanis , Afghanis and Bangladeshis that how they are treated in the gulf countries. </p>

<p>Please keep the good work . </p>
