                    <div class="content"><p>Either we are Muslims , Buddhists , Jain's or Hindus. No other race respects religion more than us. We all south Asian countries should focus on secularism. </p>

<p>I've read some posts on this sub and realised it's the whole world against us. I heard Pakistani people gets verbally racist attacks and discrimination in the middle east.</p>

<p>Those people who made Afghan , Pakistan Bangladesh and Maldives a Muslim majority, they themselves don't believe or practice that religion anymore. I'm talking about central Asian countries like Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistanis. Some of them even banned making mosques and banned Borkha and Hijab , banned holiday in the Eid day.</p>
