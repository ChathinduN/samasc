                    <div class="content"><p>"Don't be boring"</p>

<p>"Be interesting"</p>

<p>Most heard phrases in the realm of socializing and dating. Of course the word "boring" is subjective.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day what is the basic difference between boring and interesting?</p>

<p>Would also preferably like to hear some examples for differences for something thing conveyed in a "boring" way and the same thing conveyed in an "exciting" way.</p>
