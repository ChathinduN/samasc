                    <p class="content">Is the struggle of getting girls in the west worth it? Like id do way better if i went back. Is that a good idea. Im 18.

Like i could do my undergrad there and pull way more. For the education, Id come back to the west to do a masters degree so that i dont have trouble getting a job.</p>
