                    <div class="content"><p>I know how you guys feel about doom and gloom posts but I just want to get something off my chest. Over the past Years, I have been seeing seeing my people and motherland constantly get Disrespected on the media, and in 2025, nothing has changed, it’s still the same for brown people. We are constantly the butt of jokes, women don‘t find us attractive, people constantly belittle us and many don’t seem to care. Its 2025 and I still haven’t seen an Indian Disney princess. The Motherland has a plethora of issues regarding women’s safety, hygiene, and cleanliness, and physical fitness, but none of them are getting fixed, don’t even get me started on how whenever a non-brown woman or man goes to India, a bunch of Indians just Swarm Them like a bunch of ants when they see some food, shit is embarrassing, and it is filled With constant conflict over dumb bullshit, and to make things worse, Trump getting Elected is amplifying this, and as a result, the Diaspora of Indians in other countries are getting hate for the things that they have nothing to do with, for example, I am an Indian American born and raised in USA, I was going shopping with some friends, and apparently, there were 2  guys, couldn’t speak good English, and the female cashier told us they were giving her a hard time over a bottle of liquor, and when she told us they were Indian, I felt so embarrassed and I apologized to her, and she was understanding, and I even had to go back in there and pretend to buy something to make sure the 2 dudes don’t put their hands on her or something(Violence against women, children, disabled and the elderly is where I draw the line), but luckily the manager was dealing with their problemI have never been so embarrassed, I am losing faith in our community and people, we will always be disrespected and looked down on if these issues aren’t fixed, and right now, I can’t see any of these issues being fixed, because India is too busy trying to compete with China instead of fixing its problems. Sorry if I come off as an asshole, but this is how I feel rn, if shit gets better, my feelings might change but for now, sayanora</p>
