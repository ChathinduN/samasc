                    <p class="content">Desi men have low social mobility as compared to white men. And this may be due to racism and unfair vilification. 

Desi men may have more difficulty forming meaningful connections as they may be “perceived” as low value.

Connection is a human need and in order to satiate that need Desi men may tolerate disrespect (casual racism, put downs) in order to maintain connection and avoid loneliness.

This trade off also may contribute to other ethnicities indifference to racist and hurtful communications with desi people as they feel their is no consequence.

Desi men may not assert themselves because that may risk them suffering loneliness.

That’s why as a Desi Men it’s important to have good social skills so you can practice assertiveness and develop strong boundaries as well as building a healthy respectful social network.

Like how I cut off a contact in my last post and I’m attending social events so I can replace my network with more respectful people. Below is the link
