Thereâ€™s more on that sub specifically.


Recent immigrants are bad/ caste/ religion/ North vs South/ Abd vs fobs ðŸ¤¢

Calling out people as individuals vs putting them in single buckets is straight up reverse racism lmao. 
People wonder why they get racist comments from other communities, bc some of yll want their validation. 

WEâ€™RE STRONGER TOGETHER!! go learn some history ðŸ’€

Edit: also I feel this sub is lot more sensible than any other desi sub</p>
