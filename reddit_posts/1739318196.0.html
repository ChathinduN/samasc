                    <div class="content"><p>I’ve been married for two years, with no kids, and lately, I’ve been feeling uncertain about what to do next. I’m 37 years old, born and raised in America, and my parents are Pakistani. While they weren’t strict about raising me as religious or culturally Pakistani, they always wanted me to marry a Pakistani woman. The truth is, I’m not as religious as most Muslims. I pray occasionally, observe some parts of Ramadan, and eat both halal and non-halal food. I’ve had my share of drinking (a lot in college and a little after) and dating women. I love American culture, even though I know it's far from perfect. I have a degree and have worked in sales and operations my whole life.</p>

<p>Before I got married, I was working as an operations manager at a retail company, balancing work with part-time school. I wasn’t actively looking for a partner at the time, but after finishing school, I felt ready. I had no trouble attracting women, but many of them wanted to see financial stability before showing interest. While I found Pakistani women attractive, I didn’t feel mentally aligned with them, especially since I was raised in America.</p>

<p>At that time, I was a district manager overseeing several retail stores. One of the owners I managed was a Pakistani man who had moved to America at an early age. His wife, born and raised in Pakistan, was very interested in getting to know me. She frequently asked why I wasn’t marrying a Pakistani girl. When I explained that growing up in America made it difficult for me to connect culturally with a Pakistani woman, she didn’t like that answer. She then started presenting herself as a more Islamic woman who was open to new experiences. She also mentioned that I was getting older, which made me worry about my age. At times, she seemed to highlight my flaws, possibly to make me feel insecure.</p>

<p>Eventually, we started spending more time together, and she began trying to introduce me to her sister. At the time, her sister had been married for a year, but her marriage was falling apart due to cultural differences. Her husband, a Pakistani-American, believed she was only with him for his money and green card. The husband was living in the central U.S., while she was in Pakistan. When she moved to the U.S., she wasn’t living with him but eventually met me through her sister. I was led to believe they were less religious than I initially thought. My father-in-law, who met me and my family, understood we weren’t particularly religious or traditional and approved of the relationship.</p>

<p>We eventually married, but now, two years in, we’re facing many problems. The biggest issue is her family. They are not humble Muslims. Her father is extremely religious and quiet but perceptive, and her mother is shrewd, often making up stories. Her sisters share similar traits, and the entire family is deeply religious and cultural. Their dynamics are toxic, and they seem to spread that toxicity to others. When I confront them about their behavior, they make excuses, as if I should just accept them and adopt their way of life. My wife is very close to her family, and I struggle to get along with them because I’m much less religious and cultural than they are. I want to note that four of her sisters are married to Pakistani men, and I’m the only one who was born in America and isn’t as religious or culturally traditional.</p>

<p>I have two sisters who are married to American men, and they tell me they don’t face the same issues in their marriages. Now, I’m concerned about raising kids with my wife. I want to raise them in my way, without the influence of her family. I’m not sure this marriage will work out, and I’m leaning towards thinking it won’t, mostly due to the cultural differences between us. At times, I even wonder if she’s using me for a green card or my money. I would really appreciate any thoughts or comments.</p>
