There is a difference between being funny and being a class clown, with the latter being known as jestermaxxing, which is where one makes themselves look stupid in order to make others laugh. I made this mistake before, not once, but twice, first time was in my youth group where I was acting hood and saying the n word all the time(mind you I am dark skinned, darker than a lot of black Americans), and it was funny at first, but it got cringe over time, and they were laughing at me and not with me, and eventually I learned the truth over quarantine but by then the youth group broke up, then fast forward to first semester of freshman year in college, where I was in the dorms and there was this girl I was obsessed with(big mistake, don’t be desperate for one girl, talk to many), and we were in the same friend group at that time, and we used to chief up a lot, and I’ve never done weed at that time, and when I hit the pen for the first time, I coughed uncontrollably, and since it was my first time, I was acting stupid, and this made me look like a complete fool, and there is probably nothing I can do to repair my image, so yeah, don’t act like a class clown, speaking from experience. And if you do this, you are only confirming the already damaging stereotype that this damn western media has placed upon us, and I accept full responsibility in what I did and I will never do it again, I will always present myself in the best light that I can, because here’s the thing, when a white man messes up, it’s his fault, but if a brown man messes up, it’s the fault of the entire brown community, do I like this, no, but sadly it is the way it is, and it is up to us to make sure we are presenting ourselves in the best light possible.
