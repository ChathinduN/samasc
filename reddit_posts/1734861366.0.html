                    <div class="content"><p>I've been making progress in fitness and socializing. It's not like I'm suddenly the life of the party, but I now have made new friends and can enjoy fulfilling conversations with people. It's a positive step for me. I am no longer the guy who is awkwardly scrolling on his phone at parties. </p>

<p>Whenever there's a gathering of friends, I see that people enjoy themselves by dancing. In the past when I was an introverted and socially anxious fuck, girls invited me to dance with them and I refused. I don't really know how to dance. It's partly shyness, but I also literally know NO moves. I try to copy/practice some moves from folks I see on TV or instagram, but I end up looking like a complete tool. The best I can muster is bobbing to the beat with my hand raised up in the air - the basic-est move ever. </p>

<p>I don't get the 'just move' advice. It's literally like Elaine from Seinfeld - I'm really that bad of a dancer. Doesn't help that I'm not really that much into music either.</p>

<p>What do you guys do?</p>
