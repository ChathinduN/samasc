                    <div class="content"><p>This is mostly directed towards Indians and the diaspora living in the US, I'm sure y'all have heard about the "Civil War" happening in the right wing about Indians "Stealing" tech jobs and how Americans are mad about that, and when Trump gets into office, things are gonna get worse, nothing to do with Trump, but a lot of his supporters, especially the WIGNATS are gonna be pissed and will try to target you, so take safe precautions and keep yourselves safe and be CAUTIOUS, but DON'T BE AFRAID, even if you are, don't show it, things should cool down by mid February, until then, everybody's gonna be mad, and we're gonna be the targets if we're don't take the right precautions, so don't go out more than necessary, and it doesn't matter if you are born here or not, if you have brown skin, they will target you, so please, I'm telling you this for your own good, things are gonna get crazy out there, and the last thing I want is to see the racism from the internet manifest into real life and some innocent brown people getting hurt. Carry a gun if you have US citizenship, if you don't, then find another way to defend yourself. Do not worry, things will get better, but for now, stay safe. </p>
