                    <div class="content"><p>2025 is up and I want to add new skills to my arsenal. I want to improve my dating life (dated only one person now) and want to develop a holistic approach towards life (got it covered by my mentors and my efforts). I want my dating life to be the main focus of this post. (I am a 20-year-old mainlander). 
My dating life has various issues. The first being 
- I find most women dumb and nothing similar between us. The last 2 girls that I talked to did not have anything similar to me. One was interested in clubbing ( this girl liked me but I was not attracted to her physically) and the other one was a yapper and social media addict. 
- This experience above has led me to hold on to a conversation with women in general as my preconceived notion is that most women are boring and have nothing good to offer except pussy (which is shallow but enough data and evidence from my experiences suggests so). I fail to have any deeper connections with women which is holding to me even approach women. 
- The idea of being accused scares me and since I am a Mainlander I feel afraid of cold approaching (biased laws). Teach me to overcome this fear and approach women. 
My stats (apparently that's the only way I can put it, sounds cringe tho ngl üíÄ)
- 1: Height - 5‚Äô5 
- 2: Physique - Cutting after two years ( 18% - 12%, I also have a good amount of muscle mass for my frame).
- 5.5-6 inches down there (I do not even know why I care when I am a Virgin) 
- I am a student so I don't make money (I do not have access to college since I am pursuing an online bachelor's and am studying on the side to become a chartered accountant ). My 24 hours are spent like this - 8 hours sleep, 8 hours study, 3 hours of gym. 
- I am a good communicator and a listener. I have a decent sense of fashion. 
- I stay clean-shaven because it shows my jawline in a better way. I have a head full of hair but some greys in between ( I dye it and make sure to have a strong haircare and skincare routine). 
- I have various hobbies. 
I have one issue tho - 0 social media presence and 0 contacts with old friends. I cut off my old school and high school friends as they were toxic to me and bullied me when I was fat and ugly. I want to make an aesthetic Instagram account with decent followers to show myself to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (I don't relate to this but was suggested this). I know 25-30 people who can follow me but they all are men except 3-4. 
Help me! </p>
