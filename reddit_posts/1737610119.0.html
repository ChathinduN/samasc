                    <div class="content"><p>I am brown, American-born, and look Indian, but I am in fact from a small obscure culture in the Middle East which has very few people and is basically dead, so I don't really have "my own people" I could get a wife from.</p>

<p>Dating in America has been horrible and frustrating. I am 32 with a well over 6 figure tech job, and I only ever managed to date one woman, who I met online last year. She was an ultra-liberal sex-positive pansexual SJW type. We did end up having sex, but other than her I never dated or had sex with any woman. </p>

<p>I think dating as an Indian or Indian-appearing man in the USA is impossibly difficult. First, Indian men are considered bottom of the barrel, and American women will go out of their way to avoid them. Not that it doesn't happen, but the handicap of being Indian makes American not want to date you as much as being a midget, having cerebral palsy, or being in a wheelchair. This is true not just for white women, but for Asian and Latina women as well.</p>

<p>It's starting to sink in that getting a wife in America will be impossible, but where would I go as a brown man without a real ethnic identity? When I went to Colombia it felt a little better than America, but not much. When I went to South Africa, it didn't feel any different from America, but then I opened up Tinder and got boatloads of matches from black women every day (in America it is more like 1 match per month). Next I am going to Europe for the first time, Central Europe to be more specific. Any other suggestions? I've never considered going to India, because my impression is you have to actually be Indian, and furthermore be part of a specific ethnicity/caste. But does anyone know about countries like Nepal, Philippines, Thailand?</p>
