<p>This woman says that Indians are unattractive because of their facial features. She points out that Indians tend to have shorter jaws, which I agree is true on average. However, I don’t understand why she only sees it as a bad trait when she later mentions Korea, where women actually prefer shorter faces and narrower jaws on themselves.</p>

<p>Next, she talks about recessed chins (though I don’t think she even knows what that means, lol). On average, our chins might not be as prominent as those of Europeans, but that doesn’t mean they’re recessed. Plus, many of us have thicker lips, which can make the chin look less pronounced. Last time I checked, thicker lips are more preferred than thin lips too. I even posted pictures of the most stereotypical-looking Indians, and none of them had recessed chins or big noses.</p>

<p>As for noses, we tend to have shorter noses on average, and they’re not that wide like the indian woman I posted. Other ethnicities, like Iranians or West Africans, actually have larger noses than us.</p>

<p>The claims about facial asymmetry and arranged marriages leading to unattractive features are complete nonsense. All races have asymmetry, and there’s no real evidence that one is more "harmonious" than another. She even tries to use personal anecdotes to back up her argument about arranged marriages lol.</p>

<p>The only thing that truly holds us back is the lack of representation and negative stereotypes. That will change as India develops. Many Indians in the mainland are poor and don’t have access to proper grooming, while diaspora Indians are affected by the stereotypes associated with looking Indian. This lowers our perceived status, which isn’t appealing to women.</p>

<p>I know a lot of south asians here already understand the real issues we face, but this post is for self-hating south asians or younger generations who think our features are unattractive.</p>
