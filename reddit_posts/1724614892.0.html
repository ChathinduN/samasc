If you think about it evolutionarily individuals who were blackpilled doomers and the "it's overrrr" types didn't get to reproduce and died the f\*ck out. The fact that people today are blackpilled doomers just doesn't make sense evolutionarily. Like why tf do these people exist? just to die tf out?

Men aren't supposed to be like that. Ur not supposed to have some software in ur brain that's telling you to just "give up bro", "it's over bro". That's literally not gonna help you survive and it's working against you. 

You see it with guys on the internet saying autistic incel shit like "brutaal" etc... There is something really wrong with these people.

NONE of y'all should be saying sh\*t like this and holding these kinds of beliefs. They're self-fulfilling prophecies. Your thoughts are powerful and have real world energy. Don't pit urself against urself like that.
