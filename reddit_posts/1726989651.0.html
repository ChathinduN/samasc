                    <p class="content">I'm 28. FoB-ish (grew up outside India, but went to college in India). I've been in the US for 5 years now. I'm not very social or extroverted but I've assimilated pretty well. Made some good American friends. But, I haven't been very successful in dating. To be clear, I'm not thirsting after white women. I don't have racial preferences, and will date anyone who isn't obese. 

I had one casual relationship 5 years ago after finishing college. Last month I went on another date with a girl. That's the extent of my dating life. No other likes on dating apps - these 2 girls were literally the only ones who ever matched with me. Women don't really seem attracted to me IRL. 

So - based on my dating history, I know I'm not hopeless. I'm not the hottest dude, but I clean up ok. I'm a 6, I'd say. 

My biggest problem is not having no game. It's having no chemistry with women. The first girl I dated, I thought my rizz was unmatched because how of quickly I was able to get into a casual relationship and have sex. Thinking back, it seemed easy only because she made it easy. 

I don't have any women friends. I've made acquaintances with them, but I never have a...vibe...with anyone. With guys it's much easier. I treat them the same, except I may censor a few dick jokes and give them more physical space that I give guys. 

And I know why this is. I grew up being a nice guy. Not a NiceGuyTM, but genuinely wanting to be nice to others just because, and not expecting anything (except that you don't be an asshole to me in return). I grew up around mostly women who had toxic views on men, and didn't really have healthy boundaries with the only male child in the family. 

I grew up being always extra polite around girls so as to not offend or creep them out. Letting the insecurity of being a "creepy Indian man" get to me when I was young didn't help. Neither did online advice about women not wanting to be approached and making them feel safe.

As a result, I can't show attraction to a woman unless she gives me some sort of indication that she's ok with it. Even them, I'm pretty slow to flirt.  Like a simple smile or not turning away when I try to maintain eye contact for one second. 

I'm not completely boring either, but my hobbies are kinda single-person. Cooking, sharpening knives, camera repair, and indie movies.

Older women love me though - like in a friendly way. They're super chatty with me although I know they're like that with most people. I've self improved enough to be comfortable by myself and have ok self esteem, but now that I want someone in my life...it seems bleak. 

How can I learn to be more flirty and casual with women? Not even to get in their pants or to be in a relationship with them - just being friends with them with no other intentions is a good start for me, because so often there are so many genuinely cool girls out there but they just don't seem to like me. </p>
