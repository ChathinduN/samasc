<p>Right in that post you have desi women in relationships with white men shitting on desi men, and the OP agreeing like a cuck. </p>

<p>I remember a post by a non desi woman (arab or white) on abcdesis long back that praised indian men, both in terms of appearance and how they are sole-breadwinner-of-the-family minded unlike 50-50 guys from other groups, and she was not just ripped apart by our esteemed female desi abcds, they used borderline wignat talking points, ("you can find men with chicken legs attractive, we all have our tastes", "<insert 10 yr old article of tourist woman getting raped in india, which has no connection with diaspora men>" etc). </p>

<p>It isn't just about this post, but the general sentiment difference: Indian men in borderline adulation of their female counterparts, while Indian women leaving absolutely no chance to shit on their men, even when they are getting +ve rep ("he kinda looks like goatavaneesh" no priya, you are just seething because the women in the tiktok comments are simping over the dude/he's in a happy relationship with a white/EA woman.) </p>

<p>u/Old-Programmer3915 (I'm assuming you are the banned reality mountain account?) you will never convince me to be pro indian women lol..<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Old-Programmer3915/"></a></p>
