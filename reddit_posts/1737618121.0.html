<p>Pretty good account we just need more of the Canadian community behind it to have a centralised place for them to identify people against us, the more Canadian-Desis that follow it the more impact it will have on those exposed on that page</p>

<p>Now we just need one for the US, AU, NZ, UK etc because I'm not seeing any </p>

<p>I might set one up like that for Australia because we are defo lacking </p>
