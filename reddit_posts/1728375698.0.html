Their perception is that Indian men are desperate for marriage because they don't do well in the dating world. They can F around to the fullest with "superior" white men and these low lives will always be wagging their tails like dogs willing to wife them up and be the "stable, loyal, caring, husbands" 

Notice how they are framed as inferior in every aspect that is validating to a man. 

Please, don't let these insults slide. Don't be their support system. Don't be their fall back options for marriage.
