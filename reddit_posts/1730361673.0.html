                    <div class="content"><p>This is just something I was thinking about when I was stoned, this question is directed mainly towards my fellow Indian/South Asian-Americans, but feel free to chime in regardless of where you're from, Which race do you think we get along with most in the states? Whites, Blacks, Latinos, East Asians, South East Asians, Middle Easterners, Mixed Race, or Pacific Islanders, and which race majority do you think South Asians would feel most welcomed and safe?(Assuming we give them the same amount of respect) Any answer besides South Asian</p>
