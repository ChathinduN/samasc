                    <p class="content">Honestly tired of seeing many hate posts which seem like they were searched for and purposely posted on here. After seeing a post yesterday about two Indian women on Twitter wanting to date other races of men I finally had enough. 


The mods on this subreddit need to do better and remove posts that are simply screenshots of people hating on south Asians and rather advocate for discussions on how to deal with hate. 


i understand our reputation on the internet isn’t good but to sit and complain about how some racist Twitter user affects your reputation so much that you can’t get a girlfriend is simply a you problem.


I truly believe some of you exhibit feminine behavior rather than being masculine and proving haters wrong through self improvement and becoming rich.</p>
