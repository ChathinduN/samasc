                    <p class="content">Hey everyone I’ve recently discovered this sub, there’s some deep convos here that should be discussed, I thought we could also do some cultural exchange. I know there’s brown men here from all over the world, but mostly from Anglo countries (US, Aus, Uk, Canada…) I’m not the only French person of Indian origin but it’s definitely much more rare lol, so if you have any questions feel free! </p>
