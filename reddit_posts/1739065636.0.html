                    <div class="content"><p>"<strong>To err is human, to forgive divine.</strong>" - Elon Musk, in bringing Marko Elez back to DOGE (<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1887957783783391423">link</a>)</p>

<p>This is after an employee (Marko Elez) of DOGE, a government task force, was found to have said "<strong>Normalize Indian hate</strong>" on X.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/bring-back-vance-says-supports-rehiring-doge-staffer-resigned-racist-s-rcna191224">Summary is here</a>.</p>

<p>Forgiveness is a decision to be made by the <strong>affected party</strong> after the offending party showed contrition.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to someone going up and kicking Elon in the nuts for being a Boer and me stepping out of the crowd and saying "It's fine, nothing to see here, <strong><em>I forgive the attacker</em></strong>".</p>

<p>Maybe this is the argument we should make instead of getting distracted and attacking Usha Vance of all people for all this.  <strong>We don't want our own government being a 'safe space' for racists.</strong></p>

<p>Nothing normalizes Indian hate more than being able to engage in it and because the <a href="https://x.com/AFpost/status/1887954896097267771">President of the United states exonerates it</a>, <strong>facing zero consequences.</strong></p>

<p>We ought to keep fighting for accountability or it all <em>will be 'normalized'.</em></p>
