                    <p class="content">My parents moved to the United States in 2005 when I was around 1 years old and my sister was 8 at the time. They moved because my mom had found a better job opportunity as an electrical engineer in Massachussetts, and I'm sure many of the first and 2nd gen immigrants can relate to this experience of moving to a western country from India due to a parent's career opportunities. 

We moved around a bit after coming to the US and ended up settling in California. Once we were situated, my dad ended up going back to Europe to work as a mechanical engineering contractor. Because my dad was often gone, I was raised by my sister and mother, two very hardworking women. My sister was still a teenager and was still figuring life out at the time, but she still made time to spend with me, and we're still extremely close to this day as a result. My mom was often busy working to provide for the family, and we didn't see her often during the day, and even when she got home she would work late into the night, me and my sister often falling asleep to the sound of her in meetings. 

It wasn't until I started elementary school that my dad decided to move back in with us. He quit his job abroad, and would stay at home, often attempting day trading, and occasionally looking for jobs. My mom tried several times to get him to work at her company, but these stints were often short lived. I think a part of him felt it bruise his ego that his wife was more successful than him, since he was raised in a culture that valued men being the breadwinners and wives being homemakers. 

My relationship with my dad has always been complicated. For a long time, I never respected him as a man because he didn't earn much money, and from what I saw of him he was quite lazy, often sitting at home on the couch doing what seemed to be nothing all day. Anytime he would try to give me advice, I would write him off as I saw him as a failure, even since I was a young kid. His resentfulness towards his life would often boil over and he would get physically abusive with me, my sister, and my mom. This only made me hate and fear him more, and as I grew up I lived in fear that he would blow up at any moment to hurt me. 

Now that I'm 20 years old, I sort of understand him better than I did back then. He never seemed like a man who wanted to have a family. He only did it because it was what his family wanted from him. Not only that but he missed his family back home, and would much rather have stayed in India where his mom and dad and the rest of his siblings were. He wasn't there when his dad died, and throughout all this loneliness, he couldn't find any employment or purpose other than cooking and taking care of two children who were rather ungrateful and only were nice to him when they wanted something from him. This isn't an excuse for the abuse, I still think that everything he did was awful, but seeing the way his life turned out made me realize that as men, we often aren't loved unconditionally, and that if we don't work hard for our success, not even our own families will love and support us. 

 In the past few years, I have come to appreciate him more for the things he does to keep the house running. He is extremely clever, and knows how to do things that I would need to call a handyman for. He never backs down from a challenge and tries to do it all himself. He brings me out to help him when a tree needs to be cut down, the hedges need to be trimmed, the attic needs to be cleaned, and we even did the electrical work to install a new set of lights in our house together. He has also been managing a property in India, and is now getting involved in a rental property we just bought here in the States too. Instead of calling a crew to clean up the lot we want to build on, he went there everyday for 3 weeks and with my mom and sister's help they cleaned it up on their own (I was in university at the time and came to help afterwards). 

The saying that "wise men learn from the mistakes of others" has helped me to realize the things in life that I need to do to make sure I am a better man than my own father. I know that many people in this subreddit have some kind of hatred towards their own fathers, but realize that it is also their first time being parents, and for most of you, they did what they thought was best even if that ended up not being the case. Instead of us complaining about how our parents fucked us up, we should be appreciating what parts they did right, and looking for ways to fill their shortcomings on our own. Being self reliant and independent is one of the most masculine qualities and that includes teaching yourself things you should know and not complaining about why your dad didn't teach them to you.</p>
