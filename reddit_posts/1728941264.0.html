                    <p class="content">Hello good people of this sub,   
  
I'm a desi who came to study in the US a few months ago. I have no idea about cooking and I'm surviving on instant food and a few things I got from home.

I recently realized that I will have serious health issues if I do not start cooking and have healthy food.

Can you guys please share some quick easy recipes that  I try to stay away from hunger and eat nutritious food.</p>
