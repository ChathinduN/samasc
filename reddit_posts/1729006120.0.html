                    <p class="content">People call me weird and insecure. Why?  
  
I'm 5'10. I wear 2 inch lifts to become 6'0. Generation Z girls are 6'0 and up only  
  
I also wear green contacts (i have black eyes). Every study shows girls find green eyes the most attractive  
  
Am I a scumbag for frauding to this extent? I just want to get laid</p>
