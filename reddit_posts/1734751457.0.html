                    <div class="content"><p>PBS is putting out a bunch of specials about muslims. Hasan Minhaj is doing a bunch of episodes about muslims on his youtube channel.</p>

<p>US spends a whole year slandering hindus, then the election happens and it forgets about us and starts paying heavy attention to muslims.</p>

<p>Their votes were nowhere enough to swing the vote, and hindus don't have enough money or votes to matter much either. Why is the establishment picking fights with us?</p>
