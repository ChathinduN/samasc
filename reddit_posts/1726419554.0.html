                    <p class="content">i’m a young (highschool) half Indian male and every day i see less point in living. I don’t why everyone suddenly started hating us but no matter how much i convince myself it doesn’t hurt me mentally it really does. it’s not the save Europe losers or the looksmaxxers that hurt me it’s the people who think what they’re doing isn’t wrong. It’s just constant hate and i’m tired living in this world. I just saw a clip of adin ross (a streamer) and in the clip they were just shamelessly being racist to indians and one his friends genuinely said something along the lines of they are the race you can attack and no one cares and he agreed it’s like they don’t think we are humans. i don’t care about adin ross but it’s crazy how such a big streamer thinks this is okay. i find myself getting depressed most days and i don’t know how to stop it. if anyone has advice on what i should do i would appreciate it.</p>
