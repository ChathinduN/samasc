                    <div class="content"><p>For context ive been working out for 4 years while learning about nutrition during that time. Until the start of 2024 the foods eaten in my home were the 'normal' Indian foods which were not the best for reaching your fitness goals. Since the start of 2024 I've successfully made a change in the foods eaten in my home through leading by example, which led to foods being consumed consisting of meat, fruit, veg, legumes and occasionally some sweets.</p>

<p>I'm not going to talk about the technical parts of losing weight, im going to assume you want to lose weight for whatever reason and I'm also going to assume you have the 'average' Indian parents ie - relatively uneducated about diet and unlikely to change their views. In this post I'm just going to tell you what ive learnt so far about making a change to your eating habits in a South Asian family.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: Your Parents Could Be Right</strong></p>

<p>It's possible your parents could be right and that you're at a perfectly healthy bodyweight right now, i don't know your height and weight so i wouldn't know what range that would be for you. Ignore if your mum or elders call you skinny because they always will no matter how much you weigh, do people around your age call you skinny and do you look skinny or are you a healthy weight now?</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Convince them Losing Weight is Healthy</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty unlikely to happen and hard to do right now, especially if you got the average Indian parents. While trying to do what's best for you, they believe their more informed about what foods are healthier for you because of them being older. This means your parents will be hard to convince, especially from their own child. You could get some authority figure (doctor) to convince them which might work, if not move to scenario 3.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3: Subtle Changes to Lose Weight Without Raising Concerns</strong></p>

<p><strong>This part is going to have most of the practical tips for changes to make in your day-to-day life</strong></p>

<p>Changing the beliefs of your family is not a prerequisite to losing weight.</p>

<p>It definitely makes it easier I'm not going to deny that, however having a family supportive of your fitness goals is not always possible so I'm going to cater towards that scenario. Luckily, an understanding family is not a requirement to be in a calorie deficit. In the long term it's a good idea to try change the beliefs of your family through leading by your example but in the short term this what i would do.</p>

<p>Desi food which makes being in a deficit easier does exist, don't try to introduce foreign foods to a family unsupportive of being a 'health freak'. Eat/make desi food that's healthy to not raise suspicion</p>

<p>Your parents are unlikely to notice you making healthier food swaps e.g. (more daal, sambar, more grilled/baked food instead of fried, tomato/onion based curries instead of oil based) , you just end up losing the weight, your parents isn't likely to be educated on diet, so the food swaps you make to be healthier won't be obvious as you obviously dieting down. Have more meat, daal, sambar etc. Basically, have more of everything that isn't rice, bread, sweets, junk food. I talk about how to stick to these healthier eating habits on my channel, if you're interested ill send a link.</p>

<p>You also want to add physical activity to increase how many calories you're burning. Go for runs or walks, get a gym membership or if it's not possible do calisthenics at a park or in your room.</p>

<p>Track your calories with your phone, this is essential. To lose the weight you must be in a calorie deficit, when making meals search up the name of the dish to figure out how many calories are in one serving of it.</p>

<p>When your free, measure out scoop of rice, curry or dishes you commonly eat, weigh it as well if you can. Search up online how many calories this amount of food is and roughly how much space it takes up on your plate. Memorise this number and use it as a yardstick. Try get familiar with how much space one cup of cooked rice takes up on your plate vs 2 cups vs 3 cups. Use the same cutlery used on the dinner table to serve food for better accuracy. Overtime you can pretty accurately estimate from eye how many calories are in your dinner based on how much rice and curries you get served.</p>

<p>If you weigh your food you'll draw a lot of attention, instead remember how many cups or scoops of the food were on your plate, then when you go back into your room log the food into myfitnesspal or your notes app.</p>

<p>If you drink protein shakes, you'll again draw attention which you don't want if you want to minimize conflict, luckily you probably don't need the extra protein anyway. A 75kg guy only needs around 110g of protein. If your obese or overweight, then calculate your protein needs with either 0.7grams of protein per cm of height or 0.7 grams per pound of your goal weight. Worst case scenario if you are not getting enough protein from your diet just keep a small tub in your bag, at school or at work.</p>
