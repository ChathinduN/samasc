                    <div class="content"><p>My mental health is bad right now because of all the hate Brown people get on social media, and I am losing hope that we will never assimilate into society due to the people in the mainland doing bad stuff and now the people here who have nothing to do with it have to suffer for no reason, now granted some of the reasons they get hate are valid but still, it hurts to see this, and I guess this is a mental battle I have to suffer alone, but if you guys can help me or talk to me, and help get my self esteem up, that would be nice, thank you guys </p>
