                    <p class="content">I'm a 24M from India. I spent the last year travelling across the world and have decided to live outside India (currently in South East Asia) despite it being harder to make friends and date as the infra and quality of life otherwise is much better. 

Coming to my question, I would like to know if I intend to eventually settle in NYC/LA/another global city where the perception of brown men isn't as bad as elsewhere, would it be useful to start learning the american/british accent right now? I've been considering hiring an accent coach for this. 

If anyone has gone through this, would really appreciate any insights</p>
