                    <div class="content"><p>Usually I'd be making posts ecouraging my brown brothers to fight back, but now I am asking for help. My life has been going well lately, grades arent too bad, I am in a rap group with two of my friends and we are gonna be grinding, and things are good, but I 've always had one insecurity, my dark skin. I am not wesley snipes type dark but I am dark enough to where people joke about it. It sucks when your own grandparents from your dad's side don't want you around because of your dark skin(which is ironic because my Dad's Dad is significantly darker than me yet he is hella colorist), and  I just can't explain it, but I sometimes feel like I am not good enough because I am dark skinned, and that no matter how good I get or how many skills I have, the first thing people notice about me is my skin color, and it sucks because my mom is much lighter than I am(she had a hispanic woman approach her and speak to her in spanish), and I assume you guys have read my last post about the rejection with the white latina girl, and I was sure my skin color and race had something to do with it. Now I know that brown folks have been making significant progress in terms of representation, but I still feel insecure about my dark skin. I am asking you guys because everybody else has only given me mainstream bs advice like "Oh you gotta love yourself" or some bs like that, because they are mostly light/medium skinned people, now granted a couple of them had the opposite where they were bullied for being light skinned in an all black school, but I need help from you guys, please help.</p>
