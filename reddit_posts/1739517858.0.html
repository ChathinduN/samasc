Interesting that I've seen a lot of blk women /asian women calling out the tired tropes, and our better half defending the movie (and a extremely insidious issue that I plan to make a different post on- reply if you want it)</a></h2>

                    <div class="content"><p>(Long post . Mods please don't delete this. Just tell me if there's some part I should change/remove. Also please temporarily pin this, this is genuinely sth. that needs to reach a lot of users)</p>

<p>Remember guys, Some time ago I made a post abt. this movie (on a diff. account) ? The chickens have come home to roost. </p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/laracuts/status/1890069357176455288">https://x.com/laracuts/status/1890069357176455288</a> (keep in mind this is a lara from katseye fan account's reply to the post I'm talking abt.)</p>

<p>Considering that the movie is basically a race recolor of "five blind dates", and EA female led movie that features an all east asian male cast for the love interests. I mentioned this in one of my prev. posts , but you have got lara , kanthony fan accounts, "brown women pretty" and other spam poster accounts (of which multiple are operated by single individuals) spam posting/rting every single post abt. the movie across social media and pushing the views to the high millions. </p>

<p>Reminds me of another instance, when mainly other WOC were calling out Mindy for portraying Indian men as misogynistic losers ,</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/shehasaudacityy/status/1878442586261643669">https://x.com/shehasaudacityy/status/1878442586261643669</a></p>

<p>yet again and you had indian women defending her , lots of gaslighting along the lines of  "mindy kaling hate in 2025 is so old. Please get sth new" . Interestingly , they did not have the same opinion abt. the wave of racism that one post by the Ind. woman who boasted abt. our natural features received- that was very much a relevant and "old" issue- but with this one you legit had posts like "Indian men crying abt. desirability politics is getting so old, when we have bigger issues to focus on" "Instead of actually relevant reasons to criticize her, like her being casteist, you have ind. men engaging in muh she portrays ind. men as bad dating options." -(gaslighting at it's finest btw- this is basically wignat tier you guys have caste system, so you deserve the racism). </p>

<p>Yeah. And I think Ind diaspora men deserve it btw (Before you come for me, I'm one myself). Like  a significantly higher percentage of Ind men have positions of power in pop culture and movie making industries compared to Ind. diaspora women (and that when ,unlike our female counterparts, we face insurmountable barriers from the racist, fetishistic establishment) and we have nothing to show for it. Meanwhile Simone received her breakthrough in Bridgerton because  an indian woman in the director/producer team, I don't remember her name, went out of her way to repeatedly request Shonda Rhimes to cast Simone Ashley , when originally Shonda had a mixed black woman in mind for the second season. I don't remember a single equivalent of this for Indian diaspora men. ON the contrary you have them making cuck WMIF movies. Shyalman has started casting his daughter with white love interests, while he still has not cast a single Indian/desi man in a significant role, barring that one movie we don't talk about. Even east asian men aren't this bad, their main problem was their women, during the 2000s making WMAF media. The men tried to get EA men into romantic/significant roles whenever they could (Fast and furious, the walking dead, the good place)  .You have posts in the thousands across twitter and tiktok asking brown women to go support the movie to get future brown women led projects.</p>

<p>And abt. the issue that I'm thinking of making a post abt. It's something far more insidious and dangerous. I've been holding on making a post abt. this bec. I just don't have the energy for social media these days. I'm too tired, so I will write , in a concise way what I mean "Indian women removing/ stripping Indian men from Indian culture and aesthetics, while including/dressing up men from other races in that culture/aesthetics- while at the same time dehumanizing , saying a equivalent of "stay away from our culture" to non desi women who try to participate in the culture, but most notably white women/white passing women". You know exactly what I'm talking about. "Picture this" is a picture perfect example of this. With women making thirst posts about hero tieffens in Indian ethnic wear. </p>

<p>Same for the love "Bride and prejudice" images/tiktoks of the white lead romancing aishwarya in Indian ethnic wear gets, same for the posts of matreyi ramakrishnan and the white love interests in ethnic wear that are some of the highest viewed/liked posts on matreyi's social media accs. including insta with thousands Indian women "XYZ non Indian guy in a kurta, needed this so bad üòç" ing on those posts, </p>

<p>and the second part- the extreme hate a netflix post/image got for putting the 3rd season both white couple in bridgerton in Indian ethinc wear, with Indian women making hundreds of tweets and and tiktoks asking why they couldn't do it with the 2nd season couple , or the energy this cute lady has for white women who dabble in our culture compared to her energy for white men. (same "shehasaudacityy" from the prev. 2 links, her username fully checks out lol.). </p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/goodbroto/status/1852023489173086517">https://x.com/goodbroto/status/1852023489173086517</a></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/shehasaudacityy/status/1843290080611598731">https://x.com/shehasaudacityy/status/1843290080611598731</a></p>

<p>She (and other women like her) get so angry at posts like this, and have such genocidal hatred for Indian men (you prob. remember that one tweet of her gloating about white men being superior because they colonised Indian men), it loops back to being cute.</p>

<p>(their problem very clearly is only non-desi women in ethnic attire, all the retaliatory fanart made against the post went out of their way to draw the white lead in Indian prince like attire, crown, jewellery and all, instead of just kurtas). How dangerous and dehumansing it is (for Indian men) should be very clear to anyone with non zero EQ. </p>

<p>Even EA women, during the height of their white worshipping weren't this bad- the "non EA dude saving the day in a EA setting" was a more a thing done by non-EA men (primarily white, black and latino), the EA women made WMAF media was in fully westernized settings (compare "to all the people I've loved" to "never have I ever"). In contrast , "non desi guy saves indian women in Indian settings" media are all being written by Indian women themselves, which is what makes it so much more disgusting. Indian women are basically turning themselves into the gatekeepers of Indian culture and aesthetics, which were primarily made by Indian men, and removing Indian men from it. While dehumanising any non desi women who try to participate in it.</p>

<p>So yeah, if you want a detailed post on the second issue (what we can do to combat it etc.) Please say in the replies.
