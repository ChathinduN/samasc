<p>This asian digest account (prob operates from a non indian desi country, or may even be the sikh diaspora) has a history of posting viral anti india memes/vids. Any sane country like china or korea would ban/censor a account like this <em>globally</em> (china is obvious, but those korean 4b accounts mysteriously dissapear/get banned after they make a twt which gets more than 1 mil views. Even the feminists themselves say - after making a post- that they will prob have to make a new account, bec this would get permabanned in a few hrs.)<em>.</em> </p>

<p>India just <em>witholds</em> accounts like this (a mainlander told me they cant access it, and i just checked with vpn) , instead of getting them permabanned (another eg. is this one <a href="https://twitter.com/136Division/">https://twitter.com/136Division/</a> ). So not only do the accounts get to continue with their bullshit, mainlanders <strong><em>can not even target the account</em></strong>  (since they literally cannot access it). Just nuke new delhi ( or whatever the indian equivalent of white house is) at this point bruh, just a few days ago we had a postive post(27 mil views). And in less than 24 hrs, this twt has gained around than half (13 mil) of the aniruddh guy's twt. Because the likes on the former are organic, while with the latter, you've got an army of jobless subcon incels and alcoholic khalistanis whose only pastimes are gooning and reposting anti indian twts (not even exaggerating, I sometimes go to these "x pajeet y" type accounts, and they alternate between making anti indian twts which get no views, reposting and likeing viral anti indian twts, and leaving heart/kiss emojis on ai morphed models.) </p>
