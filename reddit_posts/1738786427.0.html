                    <div class="content"><p>(I've not seen one post targeting specifically one of the other individuals- during the initial reveal phase via that Wired article, the entire grp was being targeted, but now it's just Akash, with vile gendered racist insults- quite similar to the way Vivek was emasculated and dehumanized after that one tweet) Consider this one for instance. <a href="https://x.com/BlackKnight10k/status/1886815782400675960">https://x.com/BlackKnight10k/status/1886815782400675960</a> There is absolutely info regarding akash's dad being an h1b (sth that Htimes <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/indianorigin-engineer-akash-bobba-caught-in-crossfire-against-elon-musks-doge-heres-why-101738666605635.html">https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/indianorigin-engineer-akash-bobba-caught-in-crossfire-against-elon-musks-doge-heres-why-101738666605635.html</a> and some buried in oblivion twts pointed out), but that isnt going to stop them from making shit up. And again, searching for Ethan Shaotran, the other asian guy in the grp. or the two white guys bring up nothing across not just twtitter, but other socmed sites too. Asian american subs are not discussing ethan , cuckbdesis are making posts and comments dehumanizing Akash. And so on and so forth.</p>
