This post is going to be deep so much sure you put on your goggles,

After engaging with the desi community I’ve made a post which outlines important areas of focus tailored for desi’s in the west

One pillar is your social network which includes your family. Your family can make a huge impact towards your life outcomes and even for most part they love you and mean the best. Sometimes in Indian families their can be negative family dynamics.

Some Abcd’s may come to conflict when it comes to dating life as there is a big shift between south Asian concept of intimacy and western views.  

This can even  lead to estrangement and disengagement from family.

I think strong communication is needed in areas like this between family members  as estrangement may be a lose lose scenario 

Have you experienced any dysfunction in your family? How did it effect you? We’re you able to find a solution? </p>
