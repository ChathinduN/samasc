                    <div class="content"><p>I'm 36, married no kids. Coming from the South Asian background I was the youngest and had to be the most obedient son. My wife has told me that my upbringing was not normal and I lack my own freedom in decisions making. My parents are now in their 70s and I'm really struggling to make decisions for myself without keeping them in mind. Part of me wants to be free but part of me is also feeling guilty since their expectations from me are not stopping/changing and they are aging. There is no rationalizing with them. </p>

<p>So the men, specially the South Asian men, how did you break out of the obedient son phase and what tips do you have? </p>
