                    <div class="content"><p>It really feels like Instagram is targeting me as a South Asian man. I created a new account and haven’t interacted with any clearly racist posts, yet I still see this content. Reporting these posts seems pointless since the moderators don’t seem to recognize anything wrong. I constantly come across comments about India on unrelated posts for no reason at all. Even on a dropshipping account, I saw racist replies like “Saar” just because an Indian person asked a question about their product. Plus, the "Save Europe" accounts are openly hating on India in their posts and comments, seemingly because they feel threatened by North Africans and Arabs. It just doesn’t make any sense!</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Looksmaxxing accounts often post comparisons of the most unattractive Indian individuals alongside the most attractive white people. It feels like they think they have to post nasty or mean stuff about India and the Indian subcontinent just to stay relevant, especially given the size of our population. It’s frustrating to see such blatant negativity and unfair comparisons being promoted online.</p>
