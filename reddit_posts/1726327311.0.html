Dont get it twisted, most men of all backgrounds struggle with getting girls. This is not a secret, if yall look around then its clear to see that. Now when it comes to advice that's available online. There is two factors at play here:

# 1. The value of self-improvement advice is overrated.

Here we go, I said it, Most people expect too much from advice to help them. If there was genuinely some advice that existed that would instantly improve your relationship with women, the person that delivers that advice would be the greatest philosopher of all time. No debates. Its time for yall to stop looking for that secret advice. If you look at reality for what it is and are honest to yourself, then you already know what it is that you are supposed to be doing. Nobody is going to hold your hand through this cause nobody really cares about you. yall got to do this by yourself. 



# 2. There are nuances at play on navigating the dating space, where problems that desi community typically face that go beyond basic self improvement.

Thats what I hope this post could be. What are some key information that yall have discovered that is unique to the desi experience that would greatly benefit everybody here to know. lets talk about it. 

  
here is my advice: 

  
There is an element of a Crabs in the bucket mentality in the community and that exist in every community but you got to recognize it and be aware of it. Misery loves company. If it appears that some of your so called "friends" are a bit too eager to hear about your problems and a bit too dismissive of your successes than you may need to consider weather its worth having them around. On the same note, do not be a crab either. if some of your homeboys are doing well in life, then be happy for them. I feel like a generation that grew up on hearing about Sharma ji ke beta and beti have got some yall convinced that if yall cant be happy then nobody should be. Sometime you could be doing the right thing, but your group dont like that so they try to make go back to your old ways so that they can be comfortable, gotta be aware of that.</p>
