                    <div class="content"><p>My nephew is desi and is about to 'graduate' from middle school in New Jersey. He was involved in soccer and basketball, but recently his Dad told me that he sucks at soccer and just runs around, whereas in basketball he actually nets and plays decently. </p>

<p>However - classic scenario - he keeps getting picked last on the basketball team. There's been some mild ribbing as well with kids saying stuff like "We don't want him, you can have him", "We already have him, give us a stronger player" etc ,. I can't really count this as bullying and the dude has got to toughen up. So now, he wants to quit basketball and stick to soccer. </p>

<p>But it's not that easy to toughen up. The team is full of stronger white and black kids and he's one of a few Indian kids. He recently hit a growth spurt and is now taller than me at 5'8. I kept telling him in the past (when I didn't know about the situation) that he should stick to basketball so he could be taller in the future. But he's skinny despite eating a lot. Teenager metabolism. </p>

<p>I've told him to bulk up and to try practicing more, but this seems like a scenario that must have often played out among ABCD kids. </p>

<p>Any advice for how he should deal with this?</p>
