<p>Ok first of all this story is just bullshit, plain and simple, there are suburbs in Australian cities with high Indian populations but no area is taken over, there would still be white people around and I see them walking around just fine with no issues, it's not like there is some epidemic of Indians in an ethnostate just assaulting people when all it takes is one little fuck up to get deported.</p>

<p>I am not picking a side in the political spectrum here, just pointing out that we don't have any side with us and showing you that sometimes it's the ones you least expect. Plus Indians are the least likely to attack a homosexual or transexual like yourself when you compare to other groups.</p>
