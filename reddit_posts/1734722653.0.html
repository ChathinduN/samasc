                    <div class="content"><p>Most Western-born brown men I know did well in school and went to an elite uni studying Law/STEM/Medicine, I am one of them. However, there is a fun side of us too and there is way more to life than academics. Without revealing too much about me, I am involved in the nightclub/event business, been seeing a HUGE surge in desi DJs and event MCs these days. I've met brown guys who dropped out of law/engineering/med school to successfully pursue their passion such as modelling, DJing or wherever life takes them. Some of them with $80K degrees from elite Ivy-equivalent institutions just to not use their degree because they've made it in other areas. Sydney &amp; Melbourne are like 7-8% Desi these days (each city has like 5.2M people), some clubs around here are completely desi owned, desi DJs are making it big and I'm here for it. I'm also involved in the luxury car rental business, I know desi-businesses with a fleet of blacked out AMGs, BMWs and Audis, this is probably the coolest business model I have encountered. We have become such a powerful group represented in politics, lobbying groups and in numbers. A lake in Australia was recently renamed to something about Sikhism because of the Sikh lobby. I don't even care about the lake but I love seeing what we are capable of. There is so many of us businesses can basically advertise in Hindi/Punjabi/Tamil only and thrive based on this demographic alone (I've seen it). Contrary to your parents opinion, there are other ways to make money or a living rather than being a Doctor or Engineer.  </p>

<p>I attend an elite uni, I usually enjoy what I study but I'm not sure if I will even use my degrees</p>
