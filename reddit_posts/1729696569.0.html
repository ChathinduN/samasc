                    <div class="content"><p>I know that media stereotypes and the image play a role but the thing is, most Asian and Indian men in the West are not doing themselves any favors either. We can talk about the physical aspects of it but I want to talk about the mental aspect of it here. The amount of whining that goes on from Asian and Indian men online when it comes to getting girls and dating is insane. Like you will see it all over Reddit across various subs where Indian men feel sorry for themselves and play victim.</p>

<p>So I used to wonder where it came from. Why is it that men of some races can hear the nastiest stereotypes about their race and just brush that off but Asian and Indian men obsess over their bad stereotypes to the point of playing victim and making their race out to be the worst thing possible?</p>

<p><strong>I think it actually begins in childhood and the impact that Helicopter parenting has, we are just seeing it unfold in dating.</strong></p>

<p>If you grew up around a lot of Asian and Indian people, what was the mentality?</p>

<p>It is <strong><em>always comparing yourself to other people</em></strong>. </p>

<p>The kid who has better grades than you.</p>

<p>The kid who got into a better school than you.</p>

<p>The kid who won more awards in Piano or Violin than you.</p>

<p>This is what growing up in heavily Asian or Indian neighborhoods or parts of the West was like. You were constantly comparing yourself to others. It was this mentality of you having to outdo someone else and if you cannot, you are worthless. </p>

<p>It is that same Helicopter Parenting comparison and upbringing now coming to life in the real world.</p>

<p><strong>But for black and white guys, it is a different upbringing.</strong></p>

<p>Sure, you may compare yourself to others but really, you are comparing yourself to yourself. You are trying to see if you can be a tiny bit better. You are trying to see if you can be better than what you were last week or last month or last year. It is that idea of trying to just be the best version of yourself rather than trying to outdo some other guy.</p>

<p>There is some comparison or need to compare but the mentality towards it is different.</p>

<p>It is more of "Oh yeah he might be good now but once I get this right I will outdo him with no problems".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with Asian and Indian guys it is "Oh fuck, he is good now, I am screwed, I will never outdo him, what will people think? Gah!". </p>
