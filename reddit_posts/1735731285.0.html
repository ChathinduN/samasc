                    <div class="content"><p>While gay men have far more fulfilling dating lives and relationships in general, I can see majority of straight men worry about their girlfriends being sluts, wives cheating on them, "outsiders" replacing them in their jobs etc.</p>

<p>This is almost similar to how many women are borderline bisexual and enjoy attention from both men and women while the "hypermasculine" idiots keep "competing" with each other.</p>

<p>Gay men don't care if they are cheated on, they don't care about the society, etc while straight men keep coping and seething at everything under the sun.</p>

<p>Men should better give up on the society and be as selfish as possible, whether it means turning gay, going only for live in relationships without risking alimony or whatever.</p>

<p>The same dumbf*cks who talk about being playboys today are the same ones who will get enraged when their wife or daughter does the same. Just enjoy life while these hypocrites seethe, cope and contradict themselves. </p>

<p>Why even bother about a society which will contradict itself a lot and blame men at the end? </p>
