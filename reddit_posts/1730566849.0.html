                    <div class="content"><p>Earlier I had posted on this sub that my diet was messed up after moving to the US, and I got a lot of good suggestions. Now, I want to start hitting the gym at my university and bulk up but I am on my own here.</p>

<p>Can you guys be kind enough to suggest a beginner weekly workout plan which I can refer to start with, I am doing this with the intention of bulking up.</p>
