                    <div class="content"><p>Word on the street is that there will be a Streetfighter movie in 2026, and Dhanush will be a part of it. I am happy to see Dhanush in another Hollywood movie, and a movie with Sydney Sweeney too, I never thought this collaboration would ever take place. I watched a lot of kollywood movies growing up, and Dhanush was great(Chiyaan Vikram is hella underrated though), and he was great in The Gray Man alongside Ryan Gosling, Ana De Armas, and Chris Evans, this was the first time I've seen Hollywood make a brown man look like something other than a complete joke. I can't wait to see what's in store for this one.  </p>
