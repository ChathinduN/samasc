                    <p class="content">When I was younger I struggled with dating a lot as I was very skinny and didn't have any chat with girls. Over time I worked on my appearance, fashion, charm and some other things that I didn't work towards also came together, so that in the last few years I get a lot of attention from non-desi girls but not desi girls. I always found this really interesting as this highlights the internalised racism of desi girls so clearly to me now (there have been multiple situations where a group of girls have been friendly/flirty towards me and the one desi girl in the group frowns the whole time and asks the group whether they can go somewhere else, desi girls have told me they'd date me if i wasn't brown, etc).   


It would be much easier for me to marry a non-desi girl, and i think i might have more in common with the average non-desi girl too. However my language, culture and my affinity to my homeland remains really important to me and I always thought that i'd end up marrying a desi girl (a view only challenged when i started receiving so much hate from desi girls over the years). So i'm in a dilemma - either go for a non-desi girl and forget about aligning on those aspects of my desi self, or continue to go through the hellish struggle of finding a desi girl who'd be interested in me. 

Would love some opinions/experience/advice from folks. </p>
