                    <div class="content"><p>Well.. I’ll start off with the elephant in the room - it’s my roommate 🤐 yes I know but yeah </p>

<p>Alright so here’s the story: </p>

<p>I moved in to a new place last month and was sharing the house with a couple that is my age. I was fine with it. We needed a third housemate to sign so were looking for one together until..</p>

<p>We found one. F24. She moved in this week </p>

<p>The first night she moved in, the 4 of us all had some wine and weed and dinner together just in the house </p>

<p>At this point, the other guy aka John aka Liz’s bf, left to his room </p>

<p>Leaving me, Liz, and the new girl, Natasha </p>

<p>We continued our little wine conversation, the 3 of us</p>

<p>I noticed at this point that Natasha started touching me a bit here and there - just casually - before putting her arm around me, looking into my eyes, etc etc all the signs </p>

<p>But, to be honest, she’s fine as fuck and I was totally not expecting her to initiate .. yeah we were all a little buzzed but.. she was initiating and I was trying to be cool and not be too responsive, especially in front of Liz still being with us </p>

<p>Well eventually it’s 2 AM and it’s still the 3 of us.. in my head I’m thinking “why hasn’t Liz left to her room yet if John left a while ago…” </p>

<p>By this point, Natasha and I are talking, laughing, light touches and hugs back and forth, she’s also slightly trash talking me saying “you know plenty of guys look at me the way you do right. I see guys like you looking at me like that all the time. Why are you looking at me like that?” </p>

<p>I was just playing those comments off and enjoying the mental dance </p>

<p>Liz finally left, leaving just me and Natasha alone </p>

<p>I told Natasha she looked tense, and she said yeah she is, so I started gently massaging the back of her shoulders </p>

<p>She was responsive to the touch and so I kept going, massaging her shoulders and neck </p>

<p>She trash talked again, saying “ooooh where did you learn this from? Are you some kind of masseuse. Who taught you?” </p>

<p>I laughed and said “taught me? What does that mean 😂 i just “learned” I guess… but I’m no masseuse at all” </p>

<p>She was really enjoying my touches by this point and I slipped one hand gently around her neck… and she was super responsive to that, moaning and leaning back into me, grinding </p>

<p>So yeah then we kissed. I slowly started to lead her back towards her room, holding her gently by the waist as we kissed </p>

<p>Leaned her against the wall right outside her door just to see if there wasn’t any hesitation from her for progressing forward… but all good, so led her into her room and laid her in bed </p>

<p>We made out a lot, she got naked, I ended up fingering her and giving her head for like 30-40 mins… quite a long time, but I was really really enjoying it and she kept saying “oh my god oh my god” over and over like 50 times that night so I just kept wanting to go and go </p>

<p>Then she turned over to fuck but I told her I didn’t want to, she said why, I sarcastically said “because it’s Day 1 duh” and she laughed and said “I like that” </p>

<p>We grinded, made out more, she fell asleep in my arms. I felt like a rockstar. She’s definitely the most physically attractive woman I’ve been with but I also knew the risk in the back of my mind </p>

<p>The next morning when she woke up, she put on her clothes but got back in bed and fell asleep on my arms again </p>

<hr />

<p>She spent the whole day the next day away from home. Texted me saying she was feeling really hungover because she rarely ever drinks, so she wanted to rest up with her aunt taking care of her. I gave her her space for the day </p>

<p>————</p>

<p>Yesterday, as the day turned to night, I’m thinking aw man… I fumbled the bag. She’s gone. Put on some music to cheer myself up. Instantly she walks in. We hug. I ask her if she wants to watch a show and she says “I’m really tired and feel bad still, I really shouldn’t have drunk that night, please don’t let me drink again” </p>

<p>I gave her a pinky promise and hug, and then asked “so.. just to make sure… what happened between us that night, that was good with you right?” </p>

<p>She said “yeah as long as we’re on the same page about it” </p>

<p>“Same page.. what does that mean” (I laugh) </p>

<p>“I don’t knowww.. what’s that mean?” She said</p>

<p>This is where I fumbled - i asked her if she needed help fixing up her room a bit since it was a bit messy, and she said “awww you’re so sweet (😭☠️). We can definitely hang tomorrow though” </p>

<p>I asked “what time” </p>

<p>She said “8:30 when I get off work?” </p>

<p>I said “ok bet.. what do you wanna do? Go downtown, just hang in here?” </p>

<p>She said “whatever you prefer” </p>

<p>I said “okay bet.. you could be a lillllll excited just a lillllll” (not with a serious tone.. just to test the waters I guess) </p>

<p>She said “I am excited!! I’m just really tired still from that day, like the last time I drank was 6 months ago. I really just need to be by my own right now for a bit. But don’t be sad! We can hang out tomorrow” </p>

<p>—————-</p>

<p>So yeah here we are today… 5 hours away from 8:30 </p>

<p>I haven’t texted her today and neither has she (we live side by side so duh) </p>

<p>But yeah.. it would be reallyyyyyy nice to not fumble this girl. She’s very very attractive and she was into me the first night so I don’t wanna lose the magic even though I KNOW I WAS CLEARLY SIMPING AND FUMBLING LAST NIGHT</p>

<p>How do I get the momentum back? I’m lowkey just telling myself to prepare for her to raincheck and postpone… just to prep myself for disappointment </p>

<p>But at the same time.. it would be fucking dope to keep the spark going if there actually still is one </p>

<p>I’m not going to fall head over heels.. I’d be totally fine with a consistent FWB situation if that’s what she wants … but I don’t wanna end up in the friendzone either after how sexy that first night was </p>

<p>Was I just a drunken hookup? Tell me there’s more I can do. I know she’s my housemate so that intensifies the risk/reward 10x but yeah guys help me out here. I know I have to be cool and composed but… she was clearly digging me at first I think </p>

<p>What do I do tonight, if tonight happens, and also if it doesn’t? </p>
