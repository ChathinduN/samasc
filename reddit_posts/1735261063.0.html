                    <div class="content"><p>I want to focus today on some of the interesting stories from Italians in the US that faced significant discrimination and systemic oppression from the broader part of the 20th century. I always want to put a disclaimer that <strong><em>I'm not a historian</em></strong>, just someone who finds these stories interesting. But what I find particularly fascinating about the Italians is that they have made large strides in their march towards equality and are basically on equal terms with other whites today.</p>

<p><strong>Italian Immigration and Discrimination</strong></p>

<p>The first major wave of Italian immigrants arrived in America between the 1880s and the onset of World War I. Primarily hailing from Southern Italy and Sicily, these immigrants were looking for economic opportunities and to escape poverty, political instability, and natural disasters in Italy.</p>

<p>Southern Italians and Sicilians faced discrimination both back in Italy and in the West. This is because Southern Italians and Sicilians were considered “not white” due to Arab influence in the region. They were <em>so not-white</em> according to the Anglo-Americans, that they were quite literally called “white n***ers”, and "n***er wops", if you can believe it. </p>

<p>With Italian immigration into America, Italians struggled with systemic oppression and marginalization. Many were criticized harshly for their culture. They were “smelly” because of the heavy use of garlic in their food. They were criticized for creating “enclaves” and not attempting to integrate into the broader culture. They were criticized for being criminals and thieves, and often were falsely accused of being involved in organized crime like the Sicilian Mafia. There was moral panic regarding the influx of Italians who feared they were going to cause economic and criminal problems in the country.</p>

<p>Italians also faced political oppression. For example, the 1924 Immigration Act imposed strict quotas based on national origins, and this significantly curtailed Italian immigration. The primary driver of this was of course, nativism, xenophobia and racism. Italians faced discriminatory practices that literally barred them from <em>unions</em>. They faced labour exploitation and had very little recourse to do anything about it. </p>

<p>Does any of this sound <em>suspiciously</em> and <em>uncannily</em> familiar?</p>

<p>Fascinatingly, the faces and names are different, but the story is always the same for Immigrants to the US. A population immigrates, stories that provoke moral outrage and disgust at those communities become amplified, its culture is mocked and ridiculed by media and culture at large, it’s economic freedom curtailed, and then the oppressors wonder "<em>why  do these ethnic immigrants stick to their own</em>?" The same thing has happened and continues to happen with South Asians worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>Italians of the Present - How did they change the Narrative?</strong> </p>

<p>Today, Italians are seen as their own individuals and community. Part of the answer here is that they are indeed white and therefore benefit from the structures of whiteness. At the same time Italians were struggling, our community, the black and Asian communities among others were all struggling too, so there is no doubt that whiteness played a role. </p>

<p><strong>Art and Humanization</strong></p>

<p><em>However</em>, another piece of this story is related to the abundance of representation. The Italians lived in blue collar areas, where they were mixing with Black, Latino and Jewish communities. This set the stage for vibrant art and music communities with Italian representation in places like New York. We got Frank Sinatra of singer fame, and Frank Stella of painter-fame that emerged out of modest, blue-collar, Italian neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>While major factors in their own right, the biggest factor, even above art and music to me that brought change to the perception Italians is the artform of <em>film.</em> It was the rise of directors like Martin Scorsese that changed everything with <em>The Godfather.</em> While the film is a tale of Italian Organized Crime, the film provided an air of sophistication, machismo and culture that provoked many of the stereotypes and assumptions made about Italians. It also symbolically espoused values relatable to many Americans. An adherence to one's family, and stories of achieving ambition and respect. One can this in greater detail in <em>The Godfather II</em> where Don Corleone is shown as a young man living in the famous low-income Italian neighbourhood, <em>Little Italy,</em> trying to survive and grow. <em>Overcoming adversity</em> is one of the most beloved motifs in storytelling, and we love to see the underdog get the power and respect he deserved all along. </p>

<p>While the film can also be seen to make stereotypes about Italians worse, the stories resonated deeply with people everywhere. The acting of Al Pacino, another Italian American, helped solidify this and it was clear that Italians in their stories had much to offer. Stories of Italians have gone far beyond the stereotypes of the Mafioso today. </p>

<p><strong>Sports</strong> </p>

<p>With Italian Americans, the man that changed the perception of Italians in sports was Rocky Marciano. A heavyweight boxer, Marciano was iconic because of his legendary undefeated streak of 49-0. Yes, that's nearly 50 fights and not a single loss. Even the classic film <em>Rocky</em> was loosely based on Marciano because of how incredible he was in the ring. Rocky Marciano was an iconic figure in sports and changed the perception of Italians, because again, <em>everyone</em> loves the story of overcoming adversity. That is why humans love sports in the first place. It's the story of beating the odds. Sports remind of us of what can be capable of, and they give nations and peoples pride. </p>

<p><strong>What do Indians Do From Here?</strong> </p>

<p>Indians can take a page out of the Italian playbook. Throughout history we have been an incredibly intelligent people, but in the postcolonial era we struggle to express ourselves in a manner that resonates with others that we share this world with. We don't win hearts and minds by exclusively becoming part of the Tech Elite, the Finance Bros, and the MAGA dipshits, we need to show spirit and humanity. </p>

<p>Yes, our community is incredibly wealthy. But what good is financial capital if you know your kids are going to be bullied for being Indian? What good will money do if a slimy wignat decides to shoot up another Gurudwara, Mosque, or Mandir because of their ignorance and xenophobia? Money doesn't block bullets, and money can only take you so far if people aren't willing to look past you for your race. </p>

<p>We need artists and thinkers. We need our South Asian Scorsese and our Al Pacino to tell our story and put our humanity on full display. We also need our Rocky Marcianos to show that we are humans fighting and conquering adversity like everyone else. We need artistic, intellectual and athletic heroes willing to represent us. I see future where this is all not too far from now. </p>

<p>The first step in this is not to not get in our own way as a community. We need to stop discouraging our children engaging in the arts and sports, and we need to support our fellow South Asians making art or pursuing sports. We live in a world where whatever career path you follow, you can make a lot of money by being smart. Let's face it, we excel at making money as a community anyway, and I don't see the result of this being different in the arts or sports either if we so choose. </p>

<p>Having <em>success</em> in these crucial areas will destroy many of the silly narratives around Indians today and help us continue to advocate for ourselves globally through politics and culture. </p>
