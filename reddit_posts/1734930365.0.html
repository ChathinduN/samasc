                    <div class="content"><p>I am coming to a point in my life where I am a lot more selective in the girls I dated. Got my own place, career, fitness still devoting etc. </p>

<p>Anyways I am honestly starting to just get turned off when I meet a white worshipping Indian girl or ethnic girl. And even when I go on a first date I get so turned off when I find out they dated a white boy. Because let's be honest, the white boys that indian girls date are bottom barrel that even white girls won't touch them. I honestly don't even try and even the urge to pump and dump isn't there. </p>

<p>I prefer a wholesome Indian girl who has always been proud of her culture and heritage and has never seen Indian men as less than. I definitely get turned off by those Indian and ethnic girls that finally come back to their culture after realizing their multiple previous white exes don't align. </p>

<p>So any ideas where I can find Indian or ethnic girls who don't white and actually have pride in their culture? </p>

<p>Without leaving the country of course. </p>
