Just wondering if anyone else feels this way. Is it normal to be resentful towards your desi dad for things like:

- Not being around much when I was a kid, but being super overprotective when he was
- Ignoring or downplaying my mental health struggles

- Never taking my career seriously unless it’s medicine or engineering. Always insisting non stem fields weren’t “real careers”.

- Constantly pushing me into medicine without letting me figure out what I actually want.

- Not teaching me how to “be a man”. I feel like I never really had a masculine role model growing up, and now I’m suffering for that.

- His whole dynamic with my mom and sister also just feels off, but I’m not even sure how to explain it.

Like, I do love him, but I can't shake these feelings of frustration. 

I truly love and cherish him though. We have had great times together and he’s one of the most supportive and important people in my life.

Anyone else dealing with this? </p>
