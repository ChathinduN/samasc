                    <div class="content"><p>(Very long post. Mods, please do not delete this . This is not a doomer post btw - I have an easy time with women. Although what it does prove is that without actual postive stereotypes and portrayal, a random hurtful comment can ruin your week even if you're swimming in poon.) (By Indian I mean desi diaspora in general, but I have not observed this behavior among my pakistani or bangladeshi girl acquaintances. Pakistani girls in particular hype up their men a lot, which I love.)</p>

<p>So you all must be aware that social media and entertainment is hyping up Indian women while degrading Indian men, but it has especially picked up steam in 2023- 2024. Ala "The women are pretty, but the men are hideous" narrative.</p>

<p>This is a post (by an Indian diaspora woman ) on a Qovestusio reel "What makes indian women so attractive" -</p>

<p>with quite a few number of likes, and it just reminded me of sth I've observed for all of my teenage life- that the level of "sexual competition " mentality Indian women hold towards their male coutnerpart has no parallel among any other race or nationality of women. Black women seethe and cuss black men when they date out, but they don't sexually compete with them- you'll see them uplifting the entire race whenever talks of media rep or beauty comes up. Same for EA women, you'll never see ones with non EA bf go out of thier way to degrade EA men, they just want to be left alone. They are also the primary consumers/promoters of kpop/kdramas and other attractive EA male media in the west.</p>

<p>Naturally, I reverted to my doomscrolling mode and searched this up in youtube too. The comments by non- indians , while not bad, went out their way to specify that it's the "Indian women" who are pretty. Literal allergy to saying the shorter sentence "Indians are good looking" even though unlike insta the vid was titled "why are indianÂ <em>faces</em>Â attractive" (Â  u/DownvoteIfYouWantMe lmao I remember a similar post on this absurd gendered beauty appreciation you made some months ago.) And of course, some predictable Indian male emasculation /dehumanization thrown in.</p>

<p>Many "polite" comments by Indian woman specifying it's not Indian faces but Indian women's faces specifically, and how "Indian dudes don't take care of themsleves" ( it's very interesting that Indian women choose models and influencers instead of an obese aunty while talking about their beauty, but picture an average Indian guy as a malnourished dehati or potbellied uncle rather than a gymgoing dude in a tier 2 Indian city - in typical racist incel fashion )</p>

<p>No other race of women tries to promote this "the women are pretty , the men ugly " narrative as much as Indian women do. This is the reason why I immediately block any brown girl beauty type accounts (accounts run by Foreign born indian women that spam post reels/tiktoks of pretty Indian influencers or actresses) whenever they show on my feed / timeline (these type of vids still show up bec they simply get too many views, there are too many of them, and I follow pro brown men content, so algo thinks I would love pro brown women content too. ). Because I know there will be hundreds of comments, by indian women, ugly non - desi women, non- desi incels who say some variation of "the women bad as hell, but I haven't seen one goodlooking Indian dude in my life" "Gorgeous Indian girls are stuck with rapey ugly Indian men" and indian women agreeing, IJBOLing or saying the same things.</p>

<p>The founder of Qovesstudio is an Indian origin man. He made a similar clip for korean men around the 2022s (I don't know the exact year) "what makes korean men so attractive". He hasn't made any such clip for brown men. It's kinda amazing that you have Indian men in the comments supporting Indian women, and hyping up their beauty- and still have a Indian woman make this comment.</p>

<p>I also see this in twitter fan account spaces. Wherever you have desi actors getting hyped up on posts with high engagement, (I have finally managed to curate my twitter algo to give me mostly white pill content ðŸ˜­) you'll have kanthony or lara (a Indian member of girlgroup Blacksawn) or other Indian girl fan accounts, or "brown beauty" accounts which spam post only Indian women (all run by foreign born Indian women btw -do they actually have a jobðŸ¤£?) bombard them with suggestions of matreyi or avantika or simone or charithra (who's already in one piece, and in dune, where she plays a romantic lead and Tabu's younger version).</p>

<p>Or in posts of dev patel where these accounts spam post "dev patel is the only brown person you guy's know ðŸ˜’" (completely valid complaint, there are a lot of good looking desi actors that have no exposure) but then start recommending female indian actors for various roles, oftentimes as a romance counterpart to non Indian men ,and not one brown manðŸ˜‘. Recent eg. of some E.asian lady recommending Dev and some white actress for wuthering heights, and kanthony fan accounts unironically started recommending RegÃ©- Jean with Charithra (they dont mind MOC as long it's not indian, evidenced by quite a few east asian man- indian woman ships that they also spam, or the recent latino beast boy Inaki Godoy +Indian raven Avantika fan cast that they are spamming everywhere based on the teen titans live action announcement. ). Or thirst posts of Aryan simhadri with "we need more curly heads in percy jackson " and spamming simone and avantika; the level of competitive seethe is genuinely insane.</p>

<p>And the times I've been unsuccessfully cockblocked by Indian girls, ("There's so many cute guys here, and you'd go for an Indian dude" *with a vomit face * and other similar incidents in clubs ) in real life deserves another article entirely. But I won't make this post longer.   </p>

<p>Have you guys noticed similar "sexually competitive" behavior among diaspora/ foreign born Indian women or desi women? Either online or IRL. Please give your experiences so that I know I'm not crazy for noticing this.Â  u/ImmortalShells remember a comment from you regarding such a experience.</p>

<p>Â u/RealityMountain7067 You are one of the few based, non- blackpilled guys here, but you here have the reason why I'll never take an Indian guy who defends Indian women seriously. This is nigh- psycopathic levels of schadenfreude and jealousy. No other group of women does this, not even non- indian desi women.</p>
