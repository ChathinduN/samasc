                    <p class="content">By this point, we have all seen the video making waves on Reddit of where the old lady harasses a South Asian man and he puts her in her place by speaking French. People will be quick to blame the immigration crisis as the reason for why Canadians are being so prejudiced towards Indians but I realized that even decades ago, the prejudice was bad. I know that this sub, like most Asian race subs, is a bit against certain taboo topics but I will discuss them.

**A deeper analysis of Canadian prejudice, black worship, and Asian hate.**

I often feel like certain cultures and nationalities have a habit of worshiping blacks but really, it does not come from a place of genuine love towards Black people. The reason for this is really just a cover-up. We all know how racist incels that talk poorly of Indians and Asians will watch a ton of interracial porn. One thing I have learned after extensively traveling this year is to be wary of any culture that worships and fawns over Black culture because a lot of times, it is not due to a sense of respect and love, it is due to this need to cover up their own prejudice.

But the logic with Anglo culture and a lot of cultures is simple. Worship black people and black culture, put on the progressive act, and now you have the free reign to be racist towards everyone else.

# But why is Anglo-Canada in particular so much worse than the US?

Why is it that the prejudice towards South Asian and Indian people is arguably the worst in Canada, and has been for many decades, compared to anywhere else in the Western world? What gives?

**We have to study Canada's place in Western Society.**

There is a South Park episode about Canada where Canada goes on strike. In the episode, no one cares that the Canadians went on strike, the whole world could give less of a crap. In many ways, this reflects how the western world feels about Canada. Compared to America, the UK, or even Australia, people do not really care about Canada or take it seriously. Even Americans rip on Canadians for being soft and fake.

I personally do not feel this way about Canadians as there are quite a few Canadians I met who were strong and respectable people. However, it is just how Canada is viewed.

**This creates an overcompensating behavior in the Canadian people.**

Someone who is seen as lesser or seen as less popular ***will do more things to be popular*** and that includes excluding others. The most popular kid can afford to hang out and be nice to the less popular kids in school. However, the people who are below the most popular kids but also not the least popular kids do not have that same privilege. For these people, *they cannot afford to be nice*. They cannot afford to hang out with the least popular kids.

I noticed that with Canadians I met from places like Toronto and Vancouver, there was this overcompensating mindset. They often went out of their way to act rude and create a bad time for everyone. A lot of times, I could not help but think if it had to do with the way Canadians are perceived. They desperately want to be liked as much as Americans and are so adamant about it.

**A good example is Drake.**

For those of you familiar with pop culture, you probably witnessed Drake get destroyed by Kendrick Lamar this year. However, for years, Drake had some nasty antics that made people hate him. He grew up rich in Toronto and tried to act like a hard gangster rapper. Deep down inside, he knew that is not who he was but instead of accepting it, he doubled down on the act.

The reason I mentioned Drake is because a lot of Canadians are actually like this. They had relatively easy lives compared to Americans and were not seen as masculine so they wanted to create that name for themselves. Now I have met some amazing Canadian people, no lie, but a lot of them are that sort of overcompensating.

# How this plays into the prejudice towards Indians.

A weak man needs a weaker man to prey on, he cannot afford to actually be nice. As much as I love Indian culture, it does unfortunately breed a ton of emasculated men. Here in Canada you had these new foreign people come in that American culture made slight fun of via Apu from the Simpsons. Well, in America it was at most surface-level jokes. In Canada, it was an opportunity to double down on the jokes.

**This prejudice towards South Asians has nothing to do with immigration or even South Asians themselves, it has to do with the Canadian mindset.**

Canadians must overcompensate, they have to. They are not seen as masculine as Americans are so they have to make up for it somehow. All of this racism, hatred, and overcompensating masculinity of Canadians comes from one place, ***their need to overcompensate***. For years, Canada was seen as a utopia and as a nice safe place where the average citizen had a relatively easy life. Canadians themselves knew this so they took an entirely different approach.

This is why so many Canadians, for decades, had been prejudiced towards Indians. They know Indians will not fight back and they know it will not cause that same uproar as being racist towards a black person.

**And this kind of mentality really cares about what others think.**

Why are Canadians overly nice to black Americans and black people? Because they know that being racist towards black people invites a bad image from the world.

Racism towards Indians and to an extent Asians? Overlooked!

Once again, people with these sorts of mentalities are followers. If the world changed tomorrow and Indians had the same privilege of being protected against racism that Black and Jewish people do, Canadians would go out of their way to be overly nice to Indians. They are just following the trends because they cannot set them like Americans can on a global stage.

**This is especially evident in the behavior and sexual preferences of white women in Canada.**

I know this is a touchy topic since the discussion of dating and hooking up with white women brings out the worst in guys on here. The reason I mention this is because it plays into the overall case I am making. Canadian White women are far more open to blacks and worship them than American women do but it is not out of a sense of genuine appreciation for black culture, it is once again due to that cover-up.

Meanwhile, compared to WFs from other Anglo countries, WFs in Canada are far more prejudiced towards South Asians. Why is this?

Because a girl insecure about her popularity cannot afford to date anyone she sees as below her and has to follow the trends on which race is cool.

An American girl can afford to overlook race because she already knows she's the shit. A Canadian girl knows she will always play second fiddle to an American girl so she has to strictly adhere to racial preferences.

# Conclusion.

In a way, I am glad to see this coming to light. I am glad that racist instances towards Indians in Canada are being shown. I am glad that the world is starting to see just how fake that whole Canadian politeness was. The fact that this is finally out in the open and on full display is great to see. Decades ago, it was hidden behind a mask but now, we are getting to see it for what it is.</p>
