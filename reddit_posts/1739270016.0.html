                    <div class="content"><p>I personally don't see any benefit in these 3 countries being loyal to the royal family, why should we give af about them? Why do we continue a tradition which has brought so much harm to us? I think those 3 countries should just leave the British Monarchy like India and Nigeria and just be a part of the commonwealth. Fuck the royals anyway.</p>
