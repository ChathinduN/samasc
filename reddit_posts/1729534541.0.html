                    <div class="content"><p>What is the importance is "aesthetics"?</p>

<p>I'm 26M, I was supposed to pursue MS CS this Fall 24 in US but didn't want to take the financial risk in this bad job market (when I say this, you all know I'm not exaggerating).</p>

<p>Anyway I'm stuck in a career situation where I have to go big and switch to a high paying job as a software developer from my entry level job. But again, I don't even need to elaborate about the job market. I just don't want to speak in detail about this depressing situation.</p>

<p>Due to this situation I cannot take an active gym membership, so I'm rather following moderate home workouts and pay for per session basis once a week so that it's effective for me cost-wise and time-wise.</p>

<p>I have never had good "aesthetics".</p>

<p>I'm 182cm tall, 72kg, lean, broad shoulders, good muscle mass but no visible muscle as I'm not buff, no flat abs  but a healthy amount of belly which "might" be interpreted as skinny fat.</p>

<p>No noticeable jawline, trimmed beard, rimless specs, no particular preference of fashion/haircut, but I use deodorant since I live in a coastal city currently.</p>

<p>What is the importance of "aesthetics" if at all I come to the US in future? Are people over there broad-minded enough to not be racist? I have been hearing "aesthetics is everything" using South Korea/Japan as an example (although I refuse to accept everything on face value)</p>

<p>Important point: I hate banter (especially forced and compulsive), loud people (especially loud + bantering people) and prefer to stick with kind, polite, mild-mannered people. That's how particular I'm about my boundaries. But in general I'm proactive and initiate conversation with everyone irrespective of age/gender.</p>
