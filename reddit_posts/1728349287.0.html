                    <p class="content">Made a post about a minor incident that I'd been struggling with and I'm amazed by the quality of responses I got. Y'all helped me self-introspect and recognize some flaws in my thinking and behavior. I just got 1-2 snarky trolling comments which is pretty good by Reddit standards I'd say. 

Just wanted to thank those of you who engaged with class and sophistication and some real wisdom. I hope to see more of such posts here. We all struggle in white spaces but we can overcome these struggles with camaraderie and shared wisdom. And while it's ok to vent once in a while, we have to continue to do some inner work. 

From my side, I realized that even though I have achieved some career and dating success, the inner work of self-improvement never stops and we have to continue to strive to be better men. And we do this by helping each other introspect and become better men.</p>
