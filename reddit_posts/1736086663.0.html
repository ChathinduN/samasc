                    <div class="content"><p>A lot has already been discussed about the recent uptick in hate against Indians. </p>

<p>One can't help but notice that the hate is gendered and specifically aimed at Indian men, not women. All the stereotypes pertain to men. In fact Indian women are often depicted as victims of their men.</p>

<p>Already, among the diaspora, Indian men didn't have the best of results in the dating market. And its sad to say but Indian women have also thrown them under the bus at every opportunity. </p>

<p>I feel like this new wave of Indian hate will make Indian women further hate and alienate Indian men.  </p>
