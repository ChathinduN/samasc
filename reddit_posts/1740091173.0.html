<p>Hello, I am conducting research for my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology and investigating Asian men’s experiences of gendered racism, or discrimination on the basis of gender and race. To be eligible for this study, you must be at least 18 years old, reside in the United States, and identify as Asian, male, and as being romantically or sexually attracted to women.  The survey will take approximately 15-30 minutes to complete. At the end of the survey, you will be directed to a separate form, where you will have the option to enter your email address to enter a raffle for a chance to win one of ten $10 Amazon gift cards. Providing your email address for the raffle will not endanger the anonymity of your responses in this study. Thank you for your time!</p>
