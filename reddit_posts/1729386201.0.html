                    <div class="content"><p>I've noticed that the attitudes towards Indian and Asian men who date white women, particularly from white men, is very different to the way black men who date white women are treated. </p>

<p>When my black friends date white women - that's fine. That's acceptable. White guys see that as 'okay' and even if they secretly don't see it as okay they definitely never mention anything out loud. Black guys are seen as 'part of the group' so it's cool when they date white women. </p>

<p>But when as Asian guy or Indian guy is with a white woman - that's suddenly not okay. Many white guys start acting hostile towards you for 'taking a white woman that isn't meant for a lowly Asian or Indian guy'. Even white guys who you'd think are your friends seem surprised by the fact that you're with a white woman, as if you've achieved some insurmountable gargantuan feat. </p>

<p>It's almost as if they're thinking "ooooooh how did that Indian/Asian guy manage to get that pretty white girl smh". </p>

<p>Even society in general doesn't really see this as a 'socially acceptable pairing' and when my Asian friend was dating this white girl people would dismiss the fact that he was her boyfriend simply because he was Asian. People would think he's just a close friend and couldn't fathom that an Asian guy could be dating a white woman. </p>

<p>Some white guys even had the audacity to flirt with his girlfriend even though they knew he was her boyfriend simply because they saw him as some inferior Asian guy that has no business dating a pretty white woman. </p>

<p>Anyone else notice these microagressions when a brown/indian/asian guy dates a pretty white woman where it feels as though white male society is implicitly trying to say "you don't belong with a pretty white woman". </p>
