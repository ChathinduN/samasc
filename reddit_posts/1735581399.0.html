                    <div class="content"><p>This post may end up sounding a little conspiratorial. This is going to be based on my personal experiences and is <strong>largely speculatory</strong>. I'm not even sure how to begin researching this either which is why I'm just turning this into a discussion online. </p>

<p>Over the last year, the online space has been a bad place for South Asians, but Indians in particular primarily because I think India represents all of South Asia on the global stage (most people in the West barely know where Bangladesh or Pakistan are, let alone places like Bhutan or even Nepal). Every comment section we go to that is Indian or Indian-Adjacent is filled to the brim with obscene racism. The typical smell, dirty, bad gene nonsense we're all unfortunately used to. </p>

<p>I caught on to this like even as early as last year December: Going on places like Instagram that are notorious for this kind of racism, every single one of these accounts spreading said racism is <em>anonymous</em>. No face, no followers, maybe some racist memes but absolutely no identifying information. </p>

<p>This could also just be trolls making anonymous accounts, and I don't fully discount that either. But it's the behaviour of some of these accounts that is also bizarre. Innocent posts by an Indian can be posted onto the platform, and within 15 minutes and you'll start getting an explosion of ragebots being racist in the comments especially if there are any keywords or hashtags that tie to you to being Indian.</p>

<p>I suspect one of two things is happening here, one bad and the other <em>really</em> bad. </p>

<ol>
<li>Indians are the largest English speaking group on the internet that is actively online. Because of this, pissing Indians off is basically a free ticket to creating high-engagement content in online spaces. Indians see negative content and come out in droves defending themselves and India, which is understandable. Even worse, when Indians don't defend themselves, anti-Indian content attracts these ragebots that then circlejerk and run up engagement. I myself have reported these videos and Instagram does absolutely nothing, because I suspect this would hurt their bottom line and why should they care about little things like <em>racism</em>, right? (/s)
<ol>
<li>The crazy thing is, I'm now seeing another side of this where influencers basically honeypot Indians into engagement. They'll caption a post "When you come to India" and they're jumping for joy and acting manic. Obviously unsuspecting Indians think it's sweet and then leave positive comments. This lends some additional credence to the theory that there is economic incentive in getting the attention of Indians and people are trying to capitalize on it.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This is <em>potentially</em> geopolitical. Botfarms obviously exist and have existed for a long time. Russia has used them effectively for their own political interests both in and outside of Russia. Russia is an Indian ally so the idea that Russia is doing this would be very confusing, but it's not outside the realm of possibility I suppose (frankly I know very little about Indian-Russian dynamics). That being said, the same model can easily be taken up in other places and I think this would be more likely. I see sometimes that the bot names are of Middle Eastern, Turkish or North African descent from time to time, but I don't think that's enough to say that these are the countries facilitating this and it could easily be the case that the originators of these accounts use these names to maintain their anonymity. I <em>do</em> wonder if there are larger forces at work that just create fake accounts, run a GPT of some sort and use it to mass print thousands of vile comments. The reason I suspect one would even want to do any of this is to stir up division and slowly erode the reputation of Indians globally. India is obviously on a pretty strong upward trajectory in virtually every economic metric and this may be threatening to certain powers that be that don't want to have to contend with another China (again, this is a <em>speculation</em>). Regardless of the originator, look how much chaos is being created against Indians already in like a single <em>year</em>. Whatever they are doing is obviously effective. </li>
</ol>

<p>What do you guys think? Is this paranoia? Have any of you noticed similar trends? </p>
