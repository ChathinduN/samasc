                    <p class="content">I come from a South Asian country and I live in a white European country. Sometimes while I’m in school my friends and classmates talk about India and how Indians smell and are the worst race of them all. They look at me to see my reaction and the only thing I say is that I’m not Indian. A few times when they see an Indian they start laughing and suing shit like look that’s your dad. Sometimes they bring up curry and laugh about it. When we get curry served in lunch they say that’s my food. Since I’m Muslim and don’t eat non halal meat I have to eat the vegetarian dish and they call me soy boy because of it and basically say that I’m weak and not masculine. I have no idea what to do about it.</p>
