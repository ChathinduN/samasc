<h1>Disclaimers</h1>

<p>This post isn't meant to shun the dental and orthodontic treatments that are actually helpful and it's certainly not meant to villainize these healthcare providers at all. This post is for desi parents and those who are younger than 18. Its main point is that certain treatments are overprescribed in our communities and may affect the social lives of Indian-American boys as they grow older. You already know these concepts if you've read the 'orthotropics' and 'mewing' subreddits.</p>

<h1>My Story: Don't be like me</h1>

<p>My siblings and I have worse faces than our parents and grandparents because we said yes to everything the dentist and orthodontist wanted when we were kids, including braces and tooth removals. Over time, our faces become vertically elongated and our eye areas started looking more sunken/buggy. Only when it was too late did we realize that these treatments were unnecessary--Our mouths had ample space in adulthood and our teeth would have all grown in anyway had we simply given them a chance. Our recessed facial bones never recovered to match our parents and grandparents.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is common in Indian-American boys. In fact you can tune in to the next National Spelling Bee and see how many Indian boys with braces have elongated faces.</p>

<p>Here are links to other examples:</p>

Even though these brothers are identical twins, the one who had teeth extracted not only has a worse face but a less attractive voice (<em>because his maxillary sinuses became smaller as a result of treatment, yielding less room for his voice to resonate</em>): <a href="https://youtu.be/1gyQNSD8Iug?si=UdM5HuppOhOkHBBt&t=123">https://youtu.be/1gyQNSD8Iug?si=UdM5HuppOhOkHBBt&amp;t=123</a></li>

<h1>But why are Indian-American boys affected more than other kids?</h1>

<p>In America, braces and wisdom teeth extractions can be a status symbol because they signify an elite or upper middle class socioeconomic background. When I was in middle school, these treatments were the "cool" thing my classmates would talk about. It doesn't help that Indian-American parents will obsess about their perceived status in their communities. If they see rich white families doing something, they want to do it too. It's no coincidence that Indian boys with braces often come from families who make top 10% income.</p>

<p>Indian parents in America don't know that these treatments may affect their sons' future dating success. They tend to blindly trust the expertise of authoritative figures like the dentist or orthodontist without questioning it. They follow their lead despite never having had any treatment on their own teeth while they were growing up in India. Again <em>I'm not saying</em> <em>these treatments are always bad</em>, just that Indian parents should be careful when discussing such decisions with their kids.</p>

<p>Greed is a problem in America: Most dentists and orthodontists are innocent and want to help people, but I've met a few who have financial motivations to over-treat patients (such as big mortgages, their kids' college tuition, and divorce alimony to pay for).</p>

<p>For example, on a recent 1st appointment with a dentist as a new patient, I was told within the first 60 seconds of meeting her that I needed to have 4 teeth removed and that my jaw needed surgery. I instantly knew she just wanted money, and she assumed I'd be gullible enough to fall for it just because I was a brown guy in a wealthy suburb. All my teeth are perfectly aligned and I have no symptoms or issues, and I'm in my 30s. I wasn't surprised to see her awful Google Reviews by other patients pointing out the same scam.</p>

<h1>How this relates to attractiveness and dating</h1>

<p>Here's why you younger guys should be cautious when you hear dentists and orthodontists point out that your smile looks bad: I have a desi friend who thankfully waited until his mid 20s to get braces. Even though his teeth were always crooked, his facial bones were great, so he had an amazing dating life in college. I on the other hand had a great smile but worse facial bones (because I got my treatment as a teenager), and my college dating life wasn't as great as his despite that he and I were otherwise very similar people and equally outgoing.</p>

<p>Most men rarely smile to begin with--The average man only smiles for a few seconds each day. Even around girls, the guys who do well are the ones who barely smile at all, because girls decide if they're sexually attracted to you based on how you look when you're NOT smiling--They care about your eyes and jawline more than your teeth. Therefore, if you're still young and growing, there's no logical purpose in worsening your facial bones (and eye area) just to improve your smile. <em>(As the popular adage goes, "You get chose witcho mouth closed")</em></p>

<p>The bottom line is that Indian-American parents and their sons should be careful when interacting with these healthcare providers. Although these providers mean well, you're ultimately the one who's in charge of your health and appearance, not them. Once your facial bones get recessed, you'll be forced to do the stuff that the internet tells you to do to compensate for it (weightlifting, skin &amp; hair care, fashion), which are just extra headaches for you. If you're younger than 18, these extra headaches can be prevented if you simply refuse the overprescribed treatments and trust orthotropics ("<em>mewing</em>") instead.</p>

<p>In fact, there are great dentists and orthodontists who have a certificate in orthotropics who can provide you with wholesome care that doesn't risk screwing over your face (https://www.orthotropics.com/find-orthotropics). Again my point isn't to antagonize these treatments but to point out that they're overprescribed in Indian-American communities. Hope this helps you young thugs who are still tryna make it.</p>
