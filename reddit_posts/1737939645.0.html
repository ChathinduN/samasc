                    <div class="content"><p>Lot of y’all might be familiar with the concept of using a magnifying glass to redirect the suns rays to a particular focal point which generates so much heat it creates a fire. 
Likewise Indians need to focus on few things which have a lot of clout and solely singularly focus on those said things ( do not diversify). </p>

<p>Here’s a list of things to singularly focus on</p>

<ol>
<li>Soccer</li>
<li>F1</li>
<li>Tennis</li>
<li>Boxing</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes the list is short but as a said, being good at these 4 things will significantly improve Indias clout. There’s no point in focusing on so many things only to be mediocre or be bad at all of them. Don’t spread yourself too thin. </p>

<p>Old Russian proverb: “ A hunter who chases two rabbits, catches none”.</p>

<p>Focus on few things but do them at a world class level. Give countries a run for their money by simply vowing to outspend them in talent development at the grassroots level.</p>

<p>India is a country with a gdp of 4.3 trillion. You can’t tell me that they don’t have the budget to make it happen. It’s just a lack of EQ. They rather put it behind random things like being good at shooting in the Olympics smh.</p>
