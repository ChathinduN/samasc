So I am M22 from India and I am gay. Not that you can tell just by looking at me (all my friends think I am straight). I have always been this gay. As early as when I was 12 years old I was attracted to men and my classmates. And after so many years I think I finally know the reason for this.

So I grew up in a middle class family where I had no brothers, only two elder sisters and mother and an absent father. My father was never interested in us and had a lot of affairs (being a policeman). He was mostly stationed in other cities so I never go enough time to spend with him. My mother is uneducated and totally dependent on him. She is super-possessive for me (which turns out to be a big factor in making me gay).

  
Since childhood, I was not allowed to step out of the house. My daily routine meant going to school, coming home, eating, sleeping and studying. No video games, No friends, no sports, no brothers, no cousin, no uncles.   
I remember when my mother stopped me from watching IPL ( I really dont know why).  
I think because of all this things where I was kept away from masculine traits, I got closer to feminity and this is the reason I am gay. 

  
There are so many other incidents but that would the post very long.   
Any criticisms/support are welcomed. I just wanted to tell this to someone. </p><p class='timestamp'><strong>Timestamp:</strong> 2024-08-22 10:03:53</p></div>
