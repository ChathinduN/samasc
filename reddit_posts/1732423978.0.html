                    <div class="content"><p>Indian Guys In America Have Decent SMV.  </p>

<p>Indian guys have decent SMV, but it is a lot more in the real world rather than online in the U.S.  </p>

<p>US-born Indian guys are actually a popular choice for interracial marriages.  </p>

<p>Dating apps aren't the whole story -- using those statistics alone can lead to misleading conclusions.  It is true that dating studies have shown that black guys generally do better than Indian guys on dating apps in the U.S.  </p>

<p>However, US-born Indian guys marry interracially at much higher rates than the local black guys.  In fact, US-born Indian guys marry interracially at slightly higher rates than the local Hispanic guys as well.  Compared to Arab guys though, the situation is different -- US-born Arab guys marry interracially at much higher rates than US-born Indian guys. This is because many Arabs in the U.S. are Christian.  </p>

<p>Indian guys and girls overall marry interracially at similar rates in the U.S.  However, 1st-generation Indian guys marry out more than girls do, and 2nd-generation Indian girls marry out slightly more than guys do.  More than 1/3 of US-born Indian guys are in interracial marriages.  </p>

<p>Indian-American guys marrying Hispanic girls is more common than Indian-American girls marrying Hispanic guys.  This is probably because the negative stereotypes of Hispanic guys are almost as bad as that of black guys in the U.S.  </p>

<p>In Eastern Europe, Russia and Latin American countries there are probably slightly more Indian guys in interracial marriages than Indian girls.  </p>

<p>How does that compare to other ethnic groups in the U.S.?  </p>

<p>More than 1/3 of US-born Indian guys are in interracial marriages, which is actually higher than some other groups of Asian-American guys.  </p>

<p>About 1/3 or slightly more of other US-born Asians are in interracial marriages.  </p>

<p>About 1/3 of local Hispanic guys are in interracial marriages, which is slightly less than US-born Indian guys.  Also, Hispanic women are slightly more likely to marry out than Hispanic men.  </p>

<p>About 24% of local black guys are in interracial marriages, whereas about 12% of black women are in interracial marriages.  </p>

<p>These statistics can be easily verified online.  </p>

<p>This is why online dating apps in America show statistics that do not translate effectively in the real world.  </p>

<p>Multiple Indian-American guys have reported online that they do much better dating offline in America than they do online.  This is because Indian guys in the U.S. are benefitting from their interracial social circles.  </p>

<p>Also, multiple American women online have said things like "Indian guys only get arranged marriages" or "Indian guys don't marry interracially."  All you have to do is do a search for "Indian guys interracial" or "Indian guys interracial tiktok" on any search engine to see plenty of Indian guys in interracial relationships, many with above-average looking girls.  </p>

<p>So, why the confusion on this issue?  Well, white Americans are more familiar with black and Hispanic interracial marriage trends simply because those are the two largest minorities in the U.S.  It is also known that Indian parents are slightly more likely to disapprove of interracial dating than white parents are.  </p>

<p>The bottom line is dating apps in the U.S. are most favorable for white guys seeking interracial relationships.  They are also somewhat favorable for black and Hispanic guys.  </p>

<p>However, the three minorities that are in smaller numbers in the U.S. -- Indian guys, Middle Eastern guys and Oriental guys -- can sometimes astronomically outperform their dating app rankings in the U.S. by maintaining interracial social circles.  This is especially true for Indian-American guys more than any other race of guys it seems.  </p>

<p>Interracial relationships are popular in the U.S., but they are actually even more popular elsewhere.  </p>

<p>Countries with moderate demand for interracial relationships:  </p>

<p>USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  </p>

<p>Countries with high demand for interracial relationships:  </p>

<p>European countries (Western and Eastern Europe) and Latin American countries (like Mexico and South American countries).  </p>

<p>While interracial dating is popular in Europe, it can vary greatly depending on the European country.  There are some small towns of Europe where interracial dating is not nearly as popular as the major cities, but there are also small towns across Europe where interracial dating is just as popular as the major cities.  It can even vary greatly in the same country.  For instance, interracial relationships are popular in London, but they may seem even more popular in other parts of England.  </p>

<p>One interesting phenomenon is that even though a relatively high percentage of US-born Indians have been intermarrying with white Americans since last century, most famous half-Indian/half-white celebrities are not Americans.  Most of the people on online lists of half-Indian/half-white celebrities are European.  </p>
