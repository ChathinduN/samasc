Don't Compare Yourself And Your Successes To White Men</a></h2>

                    <div class="content"><p>For years, I struggled with dating while constantly comparing myself to my 3 white friends who were my main wingmen. They seemed to be succeeding effortlessly, getting dates and making connections while I felt like I was always falling short. And we had all started at the sa<strong>a</strong>me time, but like a couple of months in, I felt like I was being left in the dust by their progress and the immediate, positive reactions from women they'd get.</p>

<p>Every time I saw them with women, I couldn’t help but wonder, <em>What am I doing wrong?</em> This constant comparison nearly ruined my confidence and my dating life.</p>

<p>I was putting in the work—going out four to six nights a week, practicing my approaches, racking up hundreds of interactions—but every small win felt like it wasn’t enough compared to their success. It was exhausting, and each time I compared myself to them, I felt more discouraged. I started to internalize the belief that my race, my height, and my appearance as an Asian guy were holding me back. That’s when I realized I was stuck in a toxic loop of comparison.</p>

<p>But here’s the breakthrough I had: <strong>Everyone has their own unique journey</strong>. </p>

<p>My white friends weren’t necessarily “better” at dating—they were playing the game on a different difficulty level due to societal perceptions. Once I stopped measuring my progress against theirs and started focusing on my own growth and improvements, everything began to change for me.</p>

<p>It wasn’t easy, but the moment I shifted my mindset and began to focus on <strong>my own journey</strong> instead of feeling inadequate compared to others, I started seeing real results. I embraced my uniqueness, worked on my self-confidence, and let go of the idea that I had to match anyone else's progress to feel successful.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever felt like you’re not measuring up, or if comparison is holding you back in dating (or life), I want to share my story and how I overcame this mindset. My latest video dives deep into the struggles I faced and how I finally let go of comparison to transform my dating life.</p>
