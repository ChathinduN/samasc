                    <div class="content"><p>So I'm an Australian born Indian who is heading back to the motherland soon, I was thinking about how receptive the women there would be to me. I'm of decent height, good looking (not being a dickhead but have been told many times), somewhat fit atm (working a lot on this) &amp; attend Australia's #1 university studying <strong>useful</strong> degrees. Curious to know any other guys experiences as a Western desi going back and meeting girls in the motherland. I'm not travelling there just for girls, it's a holiday and I thought I would see how I go.</p>

<p>Itinerary: Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu </p>
