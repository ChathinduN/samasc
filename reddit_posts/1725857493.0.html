                    <p class="content">I was recently at a family gathering and I was told to go supervise the little kids. They were mostly 6-8 and there was this one boy who was about 7. This boy I knew he had some form of autism, he wasn't with the group, engaging in the convo with the other kids (the other kids were discussing movies while he just wanted to talk about his obsessions with his teachers jackets). He was trying to talk to the other kids about it and they were just laughing at him and telling him they don't care. One of the other kids told him "no one cares about that sht you sped retard" (kids really be learning language like that mad early I guess) One of the little girls asked me if he was sped. I jus told her that's not your business because obviously I don't wanna get into a discussion with a little kid about something they may not be fully aware of.

Then I see the 7 year old autistic boy's parents. They told me that many teachers at the school suggest that they test their son for autism but the parents said that it's just normal little kid behavior and how their son knows middle school math as a 2nd grader and how he's super knowledgeable about history and science. They told me that they tell the teachers how can he be autistic, he's super smart. This kid was stimming, pacing, and humming back and forth while flapping his hands (all autism traits). (The family who was hosting the party had a playground in the backyard) when the other kids were outside playing tag with each other, all this boy would be doing is swinging back and forth while humming and making noises. Even when other kids tried talking to him he would tell them a random fact instead of saying hi back.

If I saw that my future kid ever wasn't talking to others by the time they were 3 or 4, I would definitely get them tested for autism. Yes that kid can be smart but he's not socially normal. </p>
