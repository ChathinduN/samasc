                    <div class="content"><h1>Preface</h1>

<p>I'm chilling at a cafe writing this, so this won't exactly be the Arthashastra, but it's been weighing heavy on my mind that I need to start writing long-form. I'm also writing free-form, no plans. This subreddit has gotten more sophisticated over the last year, but I'm a long-time lurker who's consistently been left longing for more accurate analysis here.</p>

<p>I'll start with a more focused topic and then maybe branch out, depending on the reception. This will be straightforward, and I'm not going to spend too much energy making sure the writing transitions well. I'm also going to keep this as tight as I can, focused, and when the post touches wider topics, I'll refrain from exploring it further, to avoid a hundred different tangents.</p>

<h1>My credentials</h1>

<p>Mid-20s, grew up in Vancouver, Canada. Have travelled all over North America, and almost every continent. Relationship-wise, financially, health-wise I'm... winning, at least by this sub's definitions. I do fun, interesting shit that I'm interested in pretty often and I ball out. I'm not a Bodhisattva, I'm no Ramanujan or Aryabhata, and I'm not exactly an influential thought-leader yet, so I'm not winning by those definitions. It's all relative. I'm not Punjabi (this is important for this post).</p>

<h1>Canada</h1>

<p>There's been a ton of recent visibility on the anti-Indian racism in Canada of the past few years. The entire international desi diaspora is cognizant at this point. Canada's being labelled as the currently worst place to be south asian. The reality is nuanced. I'll flatly state one implied conclusion of this post: Vancouver / western canada is/was one of the best places to be south asian in the anglosphere (Canada / US / Aus / NZ / UK), outside of certain spots in the UK (probably, I have less experience here).</p>

<p>Rough history lesson:</p>

<ol>
<li>Punjabis first immigrated to BC (British Columbia) in the late 19th century</li>
<li>They of course faced a lot of discrimination, most classically remembered via the Komagata Maru incident: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komagata_Maru_incident">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komagata_Maru_incident</a></li>
<li>Punjabis go through a LOT in western canada in the 20th century, there's a whole Khalistani sub-plot lore-wise. Skipping over a lot.</li>
<li>As happens to many minority communities in the anglosphere, Indo-Canadians form gangs in the late 80s and early 90s to protect their community from whites exacting violence on them just for being Indian. See Bindy Johal / Brother's Keepers lore: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjMUJRAcSls">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjMUJRAcSls</a> (Bindy), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJsBKCxFMlc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJsBKCxFMlc</a> (recent stuff).</li>
</ol>

<p>This all ends up in a couple discernible outcomes:</p>

<h1>Culture (surface)</h1>

<p>a) Vancouver culture is heavily, heavily influenced by Punjabi culture, whether the whites in Vancouver want to admit it or not. Hint they don't and won't, just like they won't admit almost all interesting artistic American culture in the last century is just appropriated black, mexican, south asian, east asian, or native american culture (eg. did you know cowboys were mexican originally? it's now the whitest cultural motif you can think of lmao). There's little artifacts like the Vancouver-only tradition of fireworks on Halloween (stemming from Diwali in October over the years), to larger components of Punjabi culture, like how people of all ethnicities in Vancouver perceive what's important. For example, the particular breed of ambition for wealth, Indian metaphysics (empathy on a spiritual level), and commitment to community.</p>

<p>b) You'll find 3rd, 4th generation punjabi families in rural, interior BC, or on Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>c) Indo-Canadians in the time I grew up in Vancouver hold a ton of cultural capital here. Nobody's exactly publicly proud of Bindy / other Indo-Canadian gangsters and the violence they caused but we're thankful to them because we grew up very, very comfortable in our identity as a result. The Punjabi gangs here have carved out a pocket of cultural safety here in Canada. There's Vaisakhi parades all over the city that span 10s of blocks. People of other ethnicities in Vancouver constantly emulate Indo-Canadian culture whether they know it or not, similar to how Gen Z culture is downstream of black american sub-cultures, gen Z slang is just AAVE, etc. Now, people aren't immune to anti-Indian propaganda in media, and the general way the west portrays India, but that's unavoidable. Trust me when I say my diaspora friends who are less-travelled and just stayed in Vancouver don't think about ANY of this shit. They just live life. They've never HAD to think about any of this.</p>

<p>d) Inter-gender relations (since I know the youngins on this sub care most about this) are great. Women of all ethnicities who grew up here are super open. Diaspora women don't even consider dating other ethnicities of men, unless they grew up in the outskirt suburbs that are culturally irrelevant and predominantly white. There's vast swathes of the city where white culture is made fun of. And genuinely, not in some retaliatory form. Note that Vancouver has white people, but no dominant form of white culture, unlike Toronto for example (whole 'nother rabbit hole here). Topic for another day, but don't be caught up in the western social construct of race, all that matters is culture and ideas. Race is just a construct, presented and imposed to let western european liberals justify colonialism when the general populace started souring on the idea of colonialism - as in, you can't be brutal to people you consider less than human. The result is that people of all ethnicities can buy into racist ideas. People may not be white but they may be bought into a white conception of the world.</p>

<p>e) Vancouver is now exporting Punjabi-Canadian culture globally, and proficiently. It's the capital of it globally. This sort of thing only happens when a group gains the confidence and security that's been able to build up in Vancouver. First the hard power, then the soft power, and then all at once.</p>

<p>AP Dhillon made it in Vancouver, Karan Aujla is from Vancouver, and the burgeoning Punjabi music industry that in a lot of ways relies on key players from Vancouver is producing Shubh, Sukha, + others from Toronto, Tegi Pannu from Sydney, etc. Moosewala made it in Toronto too, but the reality is the global Punjabi music industry is built on roots in Vancouver and the U.K. I've been bumping these guys so often recently:</p>

<p>Sukha: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FnZO-U5oHo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FnZO-U5oHo</a></p>

<p>Tegi Pannu: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpDeaFi4FI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpDeaFi4FI</a></p>

<p>The result is things like this:</p>

<p>It's important to export culture! Visibility is important! I've already started hearing Punjabi music in clubs in NYC and Miami. Know that music executives are leaning hard into latin and west african (mainly afrobeats) music right now. Latin / Afro / Punjabi music is looking to be internationally dominant for the foreseeable future, but in my honest opinion the emotional depth of Indian music is unparalleled. Our civilization has just explored music so much deeper than most places, and the level of consciousness we achieved 2000 years ago is something the rest of the world is barely catching up to in the modern day, and only due to importing our metaphysics and philosophy! Anyways, topic for another day.</p>

<h1>Culture (deeper)</h1>

<p>Deeper than surface level culture (music, clothes) is ethics, ideals and what's right. One thing is clear: the west has slowly imported Indian metaphysics, philosophy, ethics and absorbed it without realizing it. This is evident on the west coast of North America. A good article on how Jung (predominant modern western psychologist that westerners look to) appropriated the shit out of Indian phil for example: <a href="https://www.idrlabs.com/articles/2014/11/how-indian-philosophy-influenced-jung/">https://www.idrlabs.com/articles/2014/11/how-indian-philosophy-influenced-jung/</a> . Empathy for all life under the construct of the oneness of reality (the Brahman) sure as shit didn't come from the Christian metaphysics the west is built on. The west coast of America spent all of the 60s, 70s, 80s importing Indian metaphysics. This deserves a whole post, so I'll keep it brief, but there's some recognition of this outside our diaspora:</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/VividVoid_/status/1853164619038343676">https://x.com/VividVoid_/status/1853164619038343676</a></p>

<p>This is what's most important, but until people connect the Indian people and diaspora to the Indian ideas they're importing in, it's meaningless.</p>

<p>Learn Indian philosophy! Learn the Indian musical system as opposed to the western system! Learn Indian ethics! And live it and spread it.</p>

<h1>Lessons</h1>

<p>To be honest, as a gen z diaspora man in Vancouver, it kind of feels like we lived in our little cultural oasis, and have only recently become aware of the racism and perceptions of the outside world. It's like we're slowly waking up to how the world is outside this walled garden (which only became a walled garden in the last two decades). It makes me/us angry.</p>

<p>There's a couple clear lessons here and the rest, I'll let you interpret and draw conclusions.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first clear way to fight back against racism / xenophobia is to export culture. Westerners commit horrendous acts daily. There's millions of videos of westerners doing vile, disgusting shit. White men make up a fraction of a percentage of the South Korean population but commit 30% of all rapes there. They're the majority of pedophiles in South East Asia despite being an extreme minority. Their region / ethnicity is never attached to it, unlike Asians - they're treated as individuals, we're not. A major part of this is the construct of race, but another major part is they have competing media that's been engrained in your head that humanizes them. You've seen them in media treated as individuals, and so has the rest of the world. This is where Sukha, Tegi Pannu, etc. help.</li>
<li>The second clear way to fight back against racism / xenophobia is deconstruction. To take something's power away, you can deconstruct it, and that requires tested, well-thought out analysis. You might think this is nerdy and the average person doesn't think about these things, but ALL of your subconsciously held beliefs, biases, etc. is downstream of thought and analysis like this. The corollary here is reconstruction: deconstruction is powerful, but pair it with reconstruction (eg. the concept of racism, after deconstructing the construct of race), and the effects are much longer-lasting. You provide an alternate, more inclusive construct that answers more of the world. You also can't just have reconstruction without educating people on the deconstruction - an example is people not understanding that race is a proxy for social class, that it's the western caste system (our caste system, in it's rigidly encoded format is also a western import), and so the reconstruction of "racism" feels flimsy to some. There's a lot of great black american literature on this, read W.E.B Dubois.</li>
<li>You need hard power before you have soft power. Confidence to export culture comes from a place of security. Vancouver is a prime example.</li>
<li>Deep insights about social life come when you experience multiple cultures. If you've lived an insulated life, it's unlikely your social insights are accurate. Here I'm self-aggrandizing, but I see it as certifiably true. A rich social life also gives you the confidence to assert your insights and values. Asserting your values isn't some autistic conscious act, it's subconscious. Luckily, our civilization has 5000 years of complex culture, which makes it easy for us to subconsciously convince others of the merits of our perspectives - people absorb our perspectives just by being around us because we have a social depth that's rare in the west. Talk to more people that aren't South Asian diaspora and have deep, earnest conversations with them. Listening will let you get through to them in a deeper, longer-lasting way. Discard this if you're living in a place where you're not really even able to do this (I don't know, maybe you're a 15 year old living in Wichita, Kansas lol) - in this instance, consciously assert your opinions and from a place of rigidity - deeply believe yourself.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Closing</h1>

<p>Fellow south asians, please write. Write, write, and write. And write honestly. Take it from me - I never thought I'd even write or contribute to this sub. At all. But it's more important than ever. I know you're all busy but fuck it, take the hour or two hours to write, it's a way of giving back to the world. If you're in a secure place, begin to exert your influence. It's an incredible outlet that only has positive implications. Especially if you have some experience in the world. Some of these youngins need us uncs to help out and lead the way. Think about how you recognize how little you know, and consider that these youngins know even less.</p>

<p>Also there's a bunch here I could expand on, if there's any sizeable reception at all to this and people want to hear more on a particular topic, just let me know.</p>
