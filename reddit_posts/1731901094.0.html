<p>Came across this clip on youtube, just goes to show you, brown people have a lot of potential, a lot of brown folks are not ugly, they just need proper hygeine and grooming, like this dude for example, he is one haircut and shower away from being a model, he already got the looks for it, nice jawline, good eye shape, full head of hair, and I'm assuming he's relatively average/tall, I mean, he may not be considered attractive in India due to the colorism, but I believe other places might see the potential in him. Apparently this man is a laborer too, thats crazy.,</p>
