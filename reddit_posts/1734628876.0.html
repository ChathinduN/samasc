                    <div class="content"><p>I have autism and adhd and am struggling to build my career. I feel like I am behind in life compared to many of my Indian friends and family friends who are killing it in shit like pre med, CS, or consulting. I feel like they see me as a loser due to not being as successful as them and being somewhat neurodivergent. </p>

<p>Can anyone relate? </p>

<p>To those in a similar situation how did it go? </p>
