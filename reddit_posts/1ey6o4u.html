There was one brown boi on the show . This is an appreciation post showcasing all of the mad simping and thirsting that was going on for this guy. 

Yeah sure he didn't quite make it too far into the show but that doesn't discredit the fact that he was mad thirsted over by chicks on social media. 

Before y'all come on here and say whack sh\*t like "reeeeee he didn't do well cuzz he's brown! reeeee" - chill TF out. The winners of this season were a **black** couple, and attractive white guys on the show like Sam were eliminated even before Munveer. So **chill TF out** with the whole **race** thing. **Race wasn't** the problem here but something else was which I'll get to. 

He got eliminated because he had **no energy** and behaved in a very very **SQUARE** manner. I get it he works as a consultant, but he could have shown some emotion. A chick literally complimented him on his hair and he just kinda walked away without really engagng like FFS wtf! SAY SOMETHING MAN. Such a boring dude. 

To survive in the villa you gotta have that edginess and boisterousness that a lot of the other guys bring. Like I said **this is not a race thing**. Attractive asf white guys like Sam even got eliminated (that too before Munveer). 

So this season was whack asf. Anyways enjoy the thirsting below for my boi Munveer :)
