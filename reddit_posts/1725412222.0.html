                    <p class="content">At my family friend gathering this year there was a group of guys and girls. About 4 guys and 8-10 girls. We are all of Indian descent living in the US and have known each other since we were toddlers but are now between the ages of 18-30 y/o. Most of the girls there had non-Indian boyfriends, mainly white, some of which were there, some weren't. I'm completely fine with this, as long as they don't shit talk on Indian men.

However, one of the older girls started bitching about Indian men and her "controlling" parents and outright stating her preference for a white boy with chill parents. She pretty much sleeps with this white guy named Matt from what I heard, although she has a PhD. She used to look alright, but from constant drinking now has black spots on her face and a chest tattoo so basically a 2/10 in looks, so I didn't give a fuck about her opinion lol.

This was right in front of two of us Indian dudes and one of the white dudes who is getting engaged with the hosts daughter (a different Indian girl). The white dude laughed it off and said he would feel sorry for his hypothetical friend Arjun but is lucky the host's daughter chose him and that she likes white dudes. The hosts daughter was NOT the same one that was bitching about Indian dudes. Pretty much after that I left that conversation and started talking to other people since I didn't want to hear that BS.</p>
