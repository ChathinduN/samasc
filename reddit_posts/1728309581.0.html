                    <p class="content">I have a female colleague at work who I occasionally mentor. She has struggles navigating workplace biases against her because she's Indian. We work in Europe. I have been successful in my company so she comes to me for advice. She has a rose-tinted view of European work culture and is disappointed with the realities of corporate culture in Europe. So I usually advise her to not fall for western propaganda and work twice as harder and to be conscious of her branding and image within the firm.

In our last conversation as she was complaining about workplace racism the topic went to relationships. She has asked a white guy out and he rejected her. She was complaining about how white guys are only chasing whites and East Asians and latinas but not her. She was saying how she thought in Europe she can be a strong and independent and confident women but it seems like white guys are too insecure for her and prefer submissive women. And then she said something that really disturbed me. 

She mentioned that she came to Europe to get a white husband because she hated indian men and couldn't find a suitor in India and then proceeded to narrate the stereotypes that we are familiar with, particularly about how insecure and judgmental Indian men are. At this point I stopped her and said that we would have a falling out if she continued with this narrative. She started getting defensive and mentioned her repeated experiences with Indian men. She said I'm not like the other Indian men to mollify me but proceeded to repeat the stereotypes. I interrupted her and told her I don't tolerate this kind of conversation and excused myself. My tone was rather harsh I will admit.

A few days later she texted and started narrating another incident of bias that she experienced. And I gave a monosyllabic response and left it at that. Yesterday I felt a little bad and texted her to check if she was ok and she replied with a curt "what prompted this message". I got annoyed but I said "Sorry for the disturbance" and left it at that. I found myself afterward being very disturbed. 

I asked myself why and I think the following:
1. Even though I'm attached and I don't flirt with colleagues I will admit I'm mildly attracted to her but I never crossed a line into flirting.
2. I find myself behaving like my old self where I'm simping for a girls attention and validation.
3. She mentioned that Indian men were insecure and not capable of handling criticism and I wonder if it's true in my case.
4. It's been a long time since I've been in the dating game having been in a committed relationship for a few years and so I guess a part of me misses that.

Just want to know from you guys what could I have done better and how do you deal with Indian women who says these things about us?</p>
