                    <div class="content"><p>So I was scrolling and saw an interracial  couple ,Indian male and white female and the literally every comments were like "bro prayed gods of every religion" ,"luckiest guy" and why?coz he's dating a white female. The guy was good looking too and vice a versa too when there was an Indian male-black female couple and the comments were like "when your visa is expiring" and both we good looking people. 
I don't have any problem with interracial dating but this polarity bothers me the fact that a white women is superior and black inferior!?!? Both are human and when two people love each other race is not a concern. When they'll understand.<br />
And this thing is not only unique to south asian but east asian and a bit in Africans too.</p>
