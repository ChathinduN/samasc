                    <div class="content"><p>This one is probably one of the most important posts that I will make. I have came across many videos of hordes of dudes in India that whenever a white female tourist goes to India, they surround her and try to take pictures with her like she's some kind of celebrity or something. Honestly, it makes me ashamed, and it also brings a bad reputation to our people worldwide. As a result, nobody, I mean NOBODY will ever wanna go there, and not to mention, the culture is also sexually repressed so dudes are just horny all the time and don't know how to act. Lust is a very big sin, and it will make you do bad things, like simping(it might seem innocent, but it can be extreme depending on the individual), sexual assault, ogling, and God forbid, Gra*e, and this perpetuates the whole Creepy Indian guy stereotype, and it doesn't just affect the Indians in India, but the Diaspora everywhere, particularly the western world, like dudes see a pretty woman and don't know how to act, and I want you to imagine this, Imagine if you had a sister, or cousin, or daughter, and a whole bunch of motherfuckers surround her trying to take selfies with her and hovering over her like flies attracted to Schei√üe, how would that make you feel, like honestly, get it together, this is kind of a vent, but I know we can do better than this, we have potential, we landed a rocket in the moon, we created plastic surgery, chess, the number 0, shampoo, YES, SHAMPOO, the word "Loot" which the Crooked teeth having bland food eating tea drinking shitty weather dwelling Brits have done for 200 years, its up to us to make sure our bretheren act like civilized human beings. Don't stare, don't grope, don't do any of that, don't invade personal space of foreigners, shower and wear deodorant, clean up your trash, keep your places clean, start small, I know its not gonna happen overnight, but take some small steps. </p>
