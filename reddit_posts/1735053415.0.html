                    <div class="content"><p>Something I've been thinking a lot about lately. The common viewpoint in most cultures today, especially those of the West, is that racial preference is something innate and that it's merely a benign preference with little consequence. We treat racial preference like a black box, with you on one side of it, people you find attractive on the other, and that something magical happens in the black box that makes you attracted without any cause, to a specific kind of man or woman.</p>

<p>This is simplistic. Environment plays arguably a larger role than even biology in the emergence of this phenomenon. Through the meticulous, yet utterly blind forces that be, Nature's most important demand is that we reproduce with other humans. Nature has no inbuilt racial preference, it just demands we continue the bloodline. It's why so much of our psychological lives and interactions revolve around dating and sex.</p>

<p>Racial preference exists as a consequence of the environments we inhabit. Our local environments were most powerful in this regard. An Indian man or woman 3000 years ago didn't have an innate preference for East Asians or Africans, because how could they be attracted to that which they've never known nor seen before? They were explicitly interested in Indian men because that was what became familiar.</p>

<p>Today, the people we meet and the conversations we have are secondary often to the online and media environments we craft for ourselves (and that others craft for us), and these environments guide our behaviours and thoughts towards certain races.</p>

<p>Modern online and media environments are powerful tools that serve the interests of a Eurocentric Western Hegemony first and foremost. White people are considered individuals, the rest of us are a monolith. African Americans are depicted as thieves and thugs, Asian men are depicted as docile and Asian women submissive, Indians are depicted dirty and creepy.</p>

<p>When we see the litany of horrific crimes whites have done for centuries, the media makes this very clear that they are not interested in generalizing. If a mass shooting happens, often due to a young white male, this is because of the <em>individual</em> being evil, not the white race. And this is true! But this same extension of good faith isn't applied as uniformly to other races.</p>

<p>Indians are regularly painted as creepy and rapacious because of the actions of a incredibly small fraction of people. Am I saying the Nation of India doesn't have a problem with misogyny or sex crime? Not at all, in fact I <em>agree</em> that it is a problem. But to put this in context, India is literally the most populous country in the world, and is still recovering from the damage caused by one of the most exploitative and vile regimes that has ever existed anywhere. It hasn't even been 100 years since India has been freed from the British Raj, and the British stole from and pillaged India for over 200. Despite knowing how poverty can cause crime it seems the actions of the few are defining the identity of Indians everywhere. This is neocolonial racism.</p>

<p>We know this context, but the world doesn't, and so this ignorance is what is fueling online hatred towards Indians right now. What's worse is that this hatred is having real world consequences. Indians through online social programming are being seen as less attractive because of ignorant and racist stereotypes.</p>

<p>The fact that black women and Indian women, and (all) Asian men are seen as less attractive is because of programming, not because we are less attractive in any material sense. We have to recognize this to be true, because the genetic narrative I see in the incel community, or even in this community sometimes is extremely damaging.</p>

<p>The fact is, you have enemies that decided to hate you before you even began to understand what hate even is, and that's entirely for your skin colour and ethnic origin.</p>

<p>The good news is, it's not over for you. You're not unlucky for being Indian in the genetic sense, merely unlucky for existing in a time as an Indian where power structures are lined up against you. But what's powerful about this is that it's an opportunity for us to make real change so that our kids don't have to deal with the disrespect, the ignorance and animosity when they grow up.</p>

<p>We have to defeat this by taking control of the narrative. Only then will we be treated with respect and will the world realize we have a lot to offer as partners and as people.</p>

<p>Going to maybe talk more about how we can change the narrative later.</p>
