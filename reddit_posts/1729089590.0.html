                    <p class="content">A huge part of our culture is our cuisine, but we're all aware that (generally speaking) South Asian (and especially Indian) diets are widely considered to be among the worst diets for people striving for fitness and athleticism particularly due to the low protein content and high carbs and fats. Advice I usually see from other South Asian people online (usually on r/ABCDesis whenever the topic comes up or even some smaller desi youtubers) seems to be along the lines of accepting your culture and just trying to eat healthier within your traditional cuisine. They say that the nutrition is fine,  and that anything wrong with your physique is because of a lack of physical activity, portion control, and genetics/epigenetics (even though 99% of people on that sub don't understand anything about genetics or epigenetics and just want to blame colonialism). I disagree, as this same cuisine is the reason why so many South Asian people look the way they do. If I continued to eat my traditional diet, but just changed the portions, I'd still have the same shitty physique I used to have even while being active and exercising. I love Indian food, but I've decided to completely stop eating the traditional diet I grew up on and I've noticed extremely positive changes in my fitness, physique, and overall quality of life.

For context, I'm 5'10", and at my heaviest, I was over 205 pounds (this was early this year). I've always carried a decent amount of muscle even without much dedicated weight training (to be fair I used to wrestle quite a bit in high school and early college), but I had a bodyfat percentage somewhere between 25-30%. I've been quite a bit stronger than my friends and others around me for most of my life, but managing bodyfat and gaining muscle at a faster rate had always been a struggle. Growing up on my traditional diet (a typical Tamil Brahmin diet), I also constantly suffered from what felt like an insatiable hunger. I could eat an entire large pizza in 15 minutes, and right afterwards, munch on whatever biscuits or other snacks that were leftover, and I'd still be hungry. I could easily eat thousands of calories and still crave more. I've wanted a strong, aesthetic physique for a while now, but my need to eat surpassed my to ability take the pounds off.

Earlier this year I started training MMA, and I decided to shift away from my traditional diet completely, while still opting to be vegetarian. I stopped making and consuming Indian dishes entirely. I started eating way less carbs and I completely cut out rice from my diet. I started getting more protein from sources like seitan, protein bread, nonfat greek yogurt, protein powder, chickpea pastas, lavash and pita wraps, as well as eating more raw vegetables and fruits. Although it was hard for me to adjust during the first week of switching, I was able to stick to my new diet, and I've experienced tremendous improvements in my physical fitness and quality of life. 

My performance in all my gym lifts have been stellar. Whether it be compound lifts, preacher curls, skull crushers, pullups, or lat pulldowns, my strength has improved tremendously, and I've broken through several plateaus. My overhead press has been the most notable change (I finally reached a 185 lb OHP after trying for almost a year). Even after dedicated weightlifting for the past 2 years, I've been gaining muscle and strength faster than before, and I'm the leanest I've been in a while. My hunger cravings are gone, I don't need to eat snacks or sweets anymore, and I can go until 3 PM without needing to eat or drink anything beyond a cup of coffee and water. My cardio has also improved tremendously. My performance in my Muay Thai and Judo classes has been stellar lately, and I don't hate going on runs anymore like I used to. The bodyfat has been coming off faster than ever, and I feel stronger, less lethargic, and more athletic since switching to my new diet. I have significantly more body confidence than I ever had before, and it's greatly improved my day-to-day mood. And yes, I now feel like I have some level of sex appeal that I never used to have before. I sometimes catch people looking in my direction at the gym, at the store, on-campus, etc. I used to get rejected by girls when asking them out in undergrad, now in grad school, I go on dates on a weekly basis. A lot of people, especially on reddit, say that improving your body attracts more attention from dudes than it does girls. As someone who's gone through the transformation myself, I wholeheartedly disagree, your physique WILL get you attention, you just have to capitalize on it. Even having girls smile at me when I cross their paths on a walking trail when they would usually pass by me without second thought really makes me feel so proud of what I've accomplished physically. And all of these changes to my life, I attribute largely to my change in diet.

I still love my traditional diet, I still love Indian food, but I really don't think that it aligns with my goals of athleticism and aesthetics, and I can't see myself switching back to Indian food/cuisine as my main diet anytime soon. Perhaps some of you might want to make your traditional cuisines using healthier methods/alternatives, but I personally would prefer to just cut out the food entirely and not make "worse versions" of the food I love. I mentioned it in another comment, but all the South Asian guys at the gym I go to who are just starting college or are still in high school are skinny pencil necks, extremely fat, or skinny fat. I rarely ever see South Asians who are fit or have a "toned" physique, and I have never seen a jacked, bodybuilder-type South Asian person in real life ever, but I've seen jacked guys of pretty much all other ethnicities. The main reason for this, despite going to the gym and working out is not genetics, its not epigenetics, its not because of the British, it's not because you were dealt a bad hand, it's because of your traditional diet. So if you're really serious about fitness and looking like the best version of yourself possible, take my two cents: **Stop eating South Asian food.**</p>
