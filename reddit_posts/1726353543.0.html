                    <p class="content">I see it all the time for years but no one is mentioning it. Multiple versions of an ad get shot, and you see the one that represents your race, diet, etc. Grubhub ad has a spliced in Indian food segment cause we're Indian, Kleenex has an Indian family, etc. Essentially, we get represented in our own little bubble.</p>
