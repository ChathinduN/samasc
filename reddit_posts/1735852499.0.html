                    <div class="content"><p>everytime theres a video thats racists to indians theres always that one guy that comments "I'm indian and i agree ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“" and they get thousands of likes because people want gratification that their racism is ok because one indian person agreed with them. </p>

<p>even when theres racist jokes (and im talking about the unfunny ones, the ones that are just racist.. and u can tell if u replace the indians they're talking about with black people for example) they always just dick ride them the hardest it pisses me off. </p>

<p>Those mfs just cant stop sucking off people who're not indian and it annoys me because it allows other people to think its ok to make fun of indians.  </p>
