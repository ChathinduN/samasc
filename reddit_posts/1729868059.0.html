                    <div class="content"><p>Guy of Indian descent here and not an Indian from India. I'm no expert on India but there is no doubting that the effects of creepy guys from South Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan) etc is a factor behind why South Asian guys have low market value in the international dating world. It is not the only factor but definitely one of the factors among many such as the poor treatment given by media etc.</p>

<p>With that being said, it dawned on me that a place like China is generally considered safe for solo female traveller's while India is not. Is there a reason for this? Could it be that Chinese men are less sexually repressed? </p>
