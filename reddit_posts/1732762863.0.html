<p>stop seeking white validation! if you really want to be treated better engage in effective advocacy and call out racism, featurism, and colorism when you see it. Anybody shaming in general should be called out as well like heightism or fatphobia. </p>

<p>a lot of the sentiment towards south asians is rooted in racism. it seems like this sub rejects this notion. Don't get me wrong some South Asians have issues, but South Asians are not a monolith. shaming them won't do anything good. I see this sub especially shaming fobs, that won't help them in anyway. </p>

<p>this trend on social media is just insecure people seeking validation from others. Validate from within! Brown is beautiful/handsome. As long as you're giving life an honest effort, doing the best you can ATM, and taking care of yourself that's all that really matters. </p>
