                    <p class="content">So I work in healthcare, and I am doing my rotations right now. 

The biggest thing I've noticed is how others will subconsciously treat you. There's a coworker of mine who smells awful- it's not BO, it's the curry smell from cooking that's infused into clothes. It's not fun waking up in the morning and smelling that first thing in the morning, and it's really strong. I don't mean to sound offensive. I also noticed how nurses, supervisors, and anyone that's not Indian will exchange looks and sometimes even subtly move away from her when speaking. Sometimes, even choosing not to sit next to her. It's easy to label it as bullying but they're all very polite to me, and whenever they speak to her, they treat her respectfully but they obviously are bothered by it. Make sure to keep clothes in the closet when cooking, and open a window. I wear cologne everyday, and nurses love me, they're always joking around and some have mentioned I smell good. So make a change.

Second thing, a thick accent is never attractive. It's something that can be a game changer if you get lessons and fix the accent.</p>
