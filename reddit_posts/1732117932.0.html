                    <div class="content"><p>If you see a FOB being weird, call that shit out. If they do not respect the law, call it out. If they smell, tell them politely (your doing them a favour in the long run since they have no idea and aren't aware). Nobody can tell the difference between a Westernised Desi or a FOB unless you talk with them. Perception and pattern recognition has an affect on all of us with things such as first impressions. Its unfortunate but thats the reality. You got people openly admitting to throwing out resumes with desi-sounding names due to how fucked our rep is rn and how we are accused of all kinds of bs such as nepotism etc and ya'll wanna act like its not our fault. The harsh reality is some of the things we face happen for a reason........</p>

<p>My pattern recognition gets called racist for some reason but it seems like 2 groups from 2 regions are ruining it for the rest of us. Although, I will leave that thought with you...</p>

<p>I am not naming or targeting any groups btw but its vital to address these issues.</p>
