                    <div class="content"><p>I know South Asians are feeling overwhelmed in North America these days.</p>

<p>First let's acknowledge the reality.   What's happening is <strong>not normal</strong> or <strong>"more of the same"</strong>.</p>

<p>There is a <em>real growing, menacing threat</em> that is not merely political, but more all-encompassing than that: <em>a society-wide current of hate</em>.</p>

<p>An infectious spread of deranged racial hatred towards South Asians, esp. via social media, and facilitated by the <em>richest man in the world</em> and one of the most powerful in our government.</p>

<p>It's now acceptable for key US government personnel to say things like "<em>Normalize Indian</em> <strong>hate</strong>".</p>

<p>A prominent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00119?utm_source=chatgpt.com">study</a> showed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Analyzing online hate speech and hate crimes across 100 U.S. cities <em>found that higher levels of targeted discrimination on social media</em> <strong><em>correlate with an increase in hate crimes</em></strong>, suggesting that online hate speech can be a predictor of offline violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While none of us can afford to take this lightly or cope our way out of it, a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>We are the most successful group in the United States.  We have solved hard problems before.  <strong>We will solve this problem too</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>If you're feeling Fear, feeling Anxiety, concerned for loved ones - you are not alone</strong>.  We are all taking it day by day, <em>wondering what will happen next and trying to plan so we and others will be safe.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>You are not "over-reacting".  You're a human being with emotions in a changing environment.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>It's not how you start, it's how you finish</strong>.  The racists have us on our back foot because honestly none of were prepared for how determined they are.  They are going to find out how <em>determined the South Asian community can be in response</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We will form the organizations now that will not only defend us now but for future generations.  This assault on our dignity being a catalyzing event.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Remember, we are in this together.</strong>  We support each other.   Whether we work in a restaurant, sell insurance, have a small business, work in tech.   <strong>We are all going through this and we will get through it together</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It took a sequence of events like this to wake us up from our primary focus on financial success to realize that <em>actions and organization in service of self-preservation matter far more</em>.</p>

<p>There will be <strong>good</strong> that comes from this challenge.</p>

<p>Let's remember as we move forward to be <strong><em>easy on each other</em></strong>, and not displace the anger we feel at how we're treated towards other South Asians.</p>

<p>Offset the hatred you observe towards us by remembering there are a lot of non-South-Asians who don't think that way, the majority-  including so many people in our lives.</p>

<p>While taking actions to thwart racists matter, <em>take enough time for your own mental health</em>.</p>

<p>Get enough sleep, physical activity, eat healthy.  <strong>Be aware of what's going on but don't got lost in the algorithm.</strong></p>

<p>Spend enough time on things and with <em>people that make you happy</em>.</p>

<p>Gandhi once said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's stay centered and composed as we work together in service of the community.</p>
