<p>Like you've literally got a black dude in the end comments making light of the racism ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1gr5yu3/comment/lx52ug4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1gr5yu3/comment/lx52ug4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button</a> ) and saying "thats how the white man wins " in the same breath- I remember a comment from a while back about how other groups literally laugh at us after being raicst to us ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1fopfto/comment/losqezi/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1fopfto/comment/losqezi/</a> ), and our cucks in the comments are batting for other POCs .I remember the itsthekumar from long ago- (I usually don't go to abcdesis, and this just reminded me why) dude is one in a series of genuine desi male cuckposters who keeps advocating for east asian male represention in media because they are "constantly emasculated" (when they have far better rep than us), about "anti- blackness" in our communites, how "we could do better" when it comes to treating desi women. (And in typical fashion, he can't get pus even from desi gals, so he copes by saying desi women are too good for desi men <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/14onrko/comment/jqm1m8u/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/14onrko/comment/jqm1m8u/</a> ). Or this guy, whos a mod on that sub. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1gr5yu3/comment/lx4yprq/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1gr5yu3/comment/lx4yprq/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1gr5yu3/comment/lx79c4d/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1gr5yu3/comment/lx79c4d/</a></p>

<p>Is there a way to prevent young desi males from joing that sub- Any method to reach out to young desi male users of reddit and have them join better subs like samasc, bronze movement. ? And to increase the exposure of this sub, (<strong>even by botting if need be</strong>)? Why do we still have a significantly lower reach than asianmasc ? And the depressing part is that I see a lot of desi blackpiller/ cucks on that sub like itsthekumar batting for ea men, crying about how much worse they have it than ea guys, fighting for them on the yasuke assasin's creed issue. - why are these guys not on this sub instead? Like the Ea dudes will mass upvote blackpill posts by indian men on their dating woes, but the moment it's a whitepill/positive post by an Indian guy, they will be heavily downvoted and asked to go to samasc)</p>
