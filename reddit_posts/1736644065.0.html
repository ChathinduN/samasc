<p>I'm still salty about mods removing my prev. post, so I'll link it here. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1hxn2te/not_only_will_you_not_see_desi_women_making_posts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_buttonI've">https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1hxn2te/not_only_will_you_not_see_desi_women_making_posts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_buttonI've</a> </p>

<p>But for all the narrative Indian women put out about how  Indian men (or more specifically "good/progressive" indian men) "aren't available" wherever they are, which is why they have only dated out of their race, they start seething when Indian guys even hint at using a gender reversed version of that logic. Case in point, my occasional sojourns to Vindicta brown, where the women engage in extreme mental gymnastics to justify how they have never dated inside their race </p>

<p>(note this is a mod of that sub, and she has a pattern of seething and dehumanising Indian men whenever reels of them appreciating white/latina/EA women are posted on that sub.). Her comments, and that of a lot of women on that sub make it very clear that "respect " is a one way street of Indian men worshipping their female counterparts , and only dating inside their race. Again, she and a lot of women have posted that any Indian guy who has dated white or latina women are an instant turnoff for them, and have comments which show their criteria for a "good Indian man" is one who has only dated brown girls, who makes reels/toks simping over only brown women ,and encourages Indian women's preferences regardless of whichever race of men they prefer (essentially a cuck). They also dehumanise women of other races who go for us, calling them "facially challenged", and making up wignat style fantasies about the women divorcing them, taking all their resources, and going for a white chad.</p>

<p>( this brings to mind u/ReasonableWealth s comments about knowing how to virtue signal, an art which Indian women have mastered, compared to their male counterparts. "I actually do find some brown men attractive, "it's just they are misogynist", "they are not many of them where I live (I live in new jersey btw)", "they hate on indian women while worshipping other races, so I'll go where I'm appreciated" (the oldest form of projection used to justify their self hate, and borrowed from black women, for whom this is a legitimate problem. And simps will see those comments and internalize that it's actually their fault, and if they were "better" they would be given a chance))</p>

<p>Again mods, please don't delete this. There is nothing about this or my prev. post that screams "cuck", infact it point out that we are doing far better than they want us to.</p>
