                    <p class="content">This is what happened to me yesterday at my local pools

I just want to remind everyone that I wrote this post a while back highlighting why it’s important for desis to develop great social skills 

I’ve been following my method every time I go swimming to my local swimming centre 

I make it a point to get meet one new person every time I go (lifeguard, receptionist, other swimmers)


But the last few times I’ve been going something cool has been happening

The receptionist are letting me just go in for free.

I know it’s small but it’s an example of how taking the time to develop good social skills can have some surprising effects in your life </p>
