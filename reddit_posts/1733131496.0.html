<p>An important comment I read (based on sth the vid creator himself said) that blacks/ latinos/ asians didnt just randomly become desirable /fetishised out of nowhere just because some tiktoker with adhd or 'tism or self -esteem issues (or a combination of all of them) started making tiktoks about a "great shift". It took years of good represantion <strong><em>and</em></strong> stamping out the bad rep. to reach the point they have reached. This only hurts indians/desis and makes them a laughing stock</p>

<p>(uncanny parallel between the governemtal-socio-cultural behavior of east asian societies esp. china, and desi socieities esp. india. One keeps their head down, ruthlessly stamps out bad rep. while flooding all- non-EA outgroups with pro -EA rep. WHile the moment we get a slight amt. or postive rep. some hot indian dude going viral, we immediately start acting like we've conquered the world)</p>
