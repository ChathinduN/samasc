<p>I have no idea why this showed up on my feed when I don't follow content from any east asian supremacist accs., maybe because I liked a repost from a korean woman on this <a href="https://x.com/vishhii_12/status/1824844249747406996">https://x.com/vishhii_12/status/1824844249747406996</a> post saying that korean men have monstrous rates of roofying and date raping women and when women , especially foreigners try to lodge complaints they are ignored at best (bec. korea does not recognise it as rape if a woman "consented" under influence of alcohol/drugs, unlike india or western  ) and persecuted at worst (for lodging a "false rape case" and defaming the man).</p>

<p>Any way, how common is the behavior in the title among desi women you know. By personal experince, I'm guessing it will be much more common among Indian, nepali , bangladeshi , sri lankan non tamil women (pakistani and srilankan tamil women have extreme self pride and love for thier men in my experience). I'm also guessing it will vary with the percentage of desi/indian population in the area, if the population of desi's is large , the women will be more wifey type and mostly stick to desi men, but if they are among a handful of desi's in the area, they will not only behave just like the woman in the first twt., they will blame Indian men for their misery, and actively try to cockblock indian/desi men too (my unfortunate personal experience). When I see some accs. simping/defending desi women, I think this is where the disconnect comes from- have a large desi pop in the area vs being a very tiny minority.</p>
