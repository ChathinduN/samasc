                    <div class="content"><h1>1. Why Poor People Are Hated</h1>

<p>Let’s be real—poor people are hated because they’re seen as uneducated, dirty, and incapable. They don’t always have the resources to groom themselves properly, and if they do, they might not have the knowledge or time to do it. Society acts like being poor is a personal failure, like it’s a choice. And the worst part? People look down on laborers, the very people who keep the world running, as if their work is disgusting or subhuman.</p>

<p>We love to pretend the class system is dead, but it’s alive and well. It’s not just an "India" problem—it’s everywhere. Laborers are still treated like shit, and their kids often end up in the same situation because escaping poverty isn’t as easy as people think. The only reason some of you believe it is? Because this subreddit and similar spaces are echo chambers for people whose parents got lucky—who had money, connections, or the privilege to move abroad. But for most poor people, the world isn’t handing out opportunities on a silver platter.</p>

<h1>2. Why Men Are Hated</h1>

<p>Let’s be honest—men get a bad rep because too many of us either act like creeps or enable creeps. Not all men, sure, but enough that the hatred isn’t random. The problem is that we let things slide. We laugh off disgusting comments as "just jokes" or "guy talk." We objectify women constantly and then wonder why they don’t trust us. And the way we talk about dating? Like women are some kind of hive mind with a single operating system we just need to "crack." It’s embarrassing.</p>

<p>All of this feeds into incel culture and, in the worst cases, rape culture. It’s not some huge mystery—if you keep making excuses for bad behavior, it eventually turns into something worse. If we actually called this shit out from the start instead of shrugging it off, we wouldn’t have so many problems.</p>

<h1>3. Why Hindus Are Disliked by Abrahamic Communities</h1>

<p>Now, let’s talk about something people love to ignore—how Hindus are treated by the world, especially by those from Abrahamic religions. Religion plays a massive role in how people see each other, and whether people admit it or not, Hindus are seen as "pagans." The words change—kafir, goy, infidel—but the sentiment stays the same: to them, we’re dirty, backwards, and lesser.</p>

<p>There’s a deep-rooted disgust toward the idea that people can exist outside the Abrahamic worldview and still have their own beliefs, cultures, and civilizations. They don’t want to be reminded that not everyone follows their religions, and they sure as hell don’t want to acknowledge that we’ve existed and thrived without them. This bias isn’t just some historical thing—it’s very much alive today. And yet, people act shocked when Hindus point it out.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Around 70% of south asians are Pagan, Majority of us are 'poor' though this a very weird word and the exact definition can vary and 52% of us are men.</p>

<p>THIS IS WHY SOUTH ASIANS ARE HATED</p>
