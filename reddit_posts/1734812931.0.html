<p>I'm not tryna shit on the Midwest but I can't not write about this after seeing so much evidence IRL for a geographic correlation.</p>

<p>Firstly, here are 2 examples (of many) to illustrate how brown men in this region can turn out socially inept -- First GOAT Avaneesh did all his cringe shit years ago at Purdue, and now this new guy recently got arrested at University of Illinois for being weird: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJKagu78pBE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJKagu78pBE</a> ; Sure, you have cringe dudes like this everywhere, and yes there are exceptions (e.g. Vivek Ramaswamy), but in my experience the Midwest seems slightly worse at producing socially well-adjusted and sexually-successful South Asian men relative to other regions.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you plot all the suicides and the murders of innocent Indian students in the U.S. over the past couple years, a surprisingly high proportion of those deaths happened in the Midwest. It seems to be an unsafe part of the country for innocent South Asian students.</p>

<p>One reason for both the socially inept men and the high murder rate could be that race relations in the Midwest are the worst in the U.S, as evidenced by segregation statistics and "race maps" of every city in the Midwest. Though Gen Z is better on this front than millennials and older generations, it's generally true that each race more strongly keeps to themselves in the Midwest relative to other parts of the U.S, even after you control for socioeconomic background. It seems like they culturally lag about 5 years behind the coasts.</p>

<p>Another reason for socially-underdeveloped young men could be that people in this region tend to act and think in the standard "Midwest nice" manner -- People don't have the guts to call out any cringe social behavior by anyone, out of fear of being perceived as rude. When someone says anything weird at school or work, the people around them don't always call out their bullshit but are more likely to just keep quiet or ignore it. Cringe or awkward social interactions will just get swept under the rug.  I've personally seen this in multiple cities in the Midwest. When people insist on speaking with "Midwest pleasantries", it only reinforces their inherent proclivity towards conflict aversiveness and does not help anyone rectify their own social mistakes. And you're more likely to end up with men like the guys listed above. Along the coasts, you don't have as much of this conflict aversion as there is less of a "politeness" filter and people are more direct.</p>

<p>Another reason for both poor race relations and social development could be the climate and geography. I know it sounds dumb but hear me out: It's much colder in the Midwest and there are no mountains or beaches or excuses for people to enjoy being outdoors. So compared to other regions, people in the Midwest are spending many more hours per week either indoors looking at a screen or driving inside their car. Doesn't take a genius to figure out how disastrous this could be for both social development and race relations.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if you Google search a map of autism diagnoses in the U.S., the Midwest is the most active region. Not saying this is something within anyone's control but at the same time it could be relevant to why this region seems to have more men (of all races) with social problems.</p>

<p>Again I'm not tryna shit on this region but I think it's worth having open dialogue about it. I've lived everywhere and have friends from every region but it def seems like the South Asian men who need the most help with their social lives tend to have roots in the Midwest.</p>

<p>Am I just imagining things? I could be wrong here but these are my observations.</p>
