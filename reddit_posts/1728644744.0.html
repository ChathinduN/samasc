As a 26 year old man, I talk to almost everyone and continue talking to polite and respectful people. 

Men in 20s are easy to talk to but many of them are assholes and impolite. While men above 30 (especially mid 30s and above) are the easiest to talk and are polite, friendly, give a lot of  friendly, constructive advise. Women above 30 are also equally friendly.

Women in 20s are the hardest to talk to and many of them are walking red flags. While many of them are not outright rude, they tend not to give open-ended answers, tend to avoid eye contact with others outside their girls group, don't smile back. I respect their choice of being closed, reserved, cold but I maintain my stand saying that they lack manners.

There are some types of women who I found are to be avoided always:

1. Gossip type: this one is straight from high school who always gossips about people but never talks directly to the same people they gossip about

2. Opportunist: while most people are opportunists, women in 20s are observed to be the biggest opportunists since they have a lot of simps orbiting them and will run errands for them even though the girl is dating someone else (I say this because those losers actively stick with their female "friend" alone while she often ditches him for some guy who asks her out without simping. This shit is funny since I asked out many decent women out for coffee, lunch, hangouts and even hooked up with one of them. She also revealed that her "simp" friend always goes out of his way to do stuff for her but didn't have the guts to ask her out)

3. Unfriendly: although it's impractical to expect women to as friendly as men, 99% of the time they lack manners, don't reciprocate politeness, cold. Again this happens because they usually have a gang of simps ready to obey her orders.

4. Zero personality: NO! I don't expect women to be charming/career bees. It's fine not not to be ambitious, it's okay to prefer becoming a homemaker. I even empathize with these types since I was also bad at expressing myself and initiating conversations during my teens. But how is it even possible to sit through and make an entire conversation one-way without asking any questions in return? Even during my teens I often ran out of stuff to say but it never went to the point of not asking questions in return. But the bright side is these women tend to be polite, smile a little and are not cold.

5. Judgmental: This is the worst of these 5 types. Almost similar to the gossip type. They don't stop at gossiping. They actually judge people 24\*7, judge based on appearances, judge people who walk past them, judge based on status etc. The worst part is they don't keep their judgements with them and turn it into a gossip.

Now before you pounce on what I said, this is not a generalization. But it's weird how women in their 20s are the hardest to be friends with or to initiate a conversation. 

Every other age group and gender is friendly enough. But the above mentioned personality types are a pain to talk with. Especially women above their 30s are kind and friendly 99% of the time.

What are some other types of women to avoid, according to you?
