                    <div class="content"><p>Before you read this, let me just say this, I know that Italians are considered white today but there's more to it, so just hear me out.</p>

<p>There are a lot of similarities between Italians and Indians and their respective diasporas in the US, both of them have had ancient civilizations, both of them have amazing food and rich history, and both place high emphasis on family and religion, and both countries are extremely diverse, and the more south you go, the darker the skin tone gets, and both the northerners and southerners generally hate each other in both of these countries. One thing about Italians though is that when they first arrived to the US, they were heavily discriminated against, especially the ones from the south, they were basically treated how we are treated today, We are going through what they went through back then(albeit for different reasons) and they eventually became considered white. Italian men in Italy are known for harassing women, not different from Indians, but nobody points it out when they do it, why, because they present themselves well, I have yet to see a brown man present himself well(correct me if I'm wrong). Now Granted, we can't be white, but we will be treated better than we are now, we have to keep assimilating more and more into American society, do sports, hit the gym, take care of our appearances, dress well (like the Italians), do more cinema related stuff, and generally do our best to put the best aspects of ourselves out there, while discarding the worst(ie bad smell, walking around with sandals, dressing like crap, not taking care of ourselves, and lack of manners, taking crap from others and not doing a damn thing about it), and try not to put each other down, but rather help a brother out, people are less likely to start some shit with us if we look out for one another rather than drag each other down and try to justify to the enemy.</p>
