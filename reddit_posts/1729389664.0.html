                    <div class="content"><p>There is this belief in a lot of South Asian subreddits and communities that compared to Indians in the UK or Canada, Indians in the US are weak and give Indian men everywhere else a bad name. In my opinion, it is quite the opposite. I feel like compared to just about any other Western or Anglo country, Indians in the US are winning big.</p>

<p>We can talk about the success of tech CEOs and making it big in that sense but I wanted to talk about other avenues as well where Indians are just killing it.</p>

<p><strong>Sports.</strong></p>

<p>Did you know that the first American to ever be in the youth academy at Real Madrid (the best soccer club on the planet) was of Indian descent? His name was Joshua Pynadath, look it up. </p>

<p>This is not to count the various Indian American players coming out of the Bay Area in soccer and in MLS Youth Academies. Nothing against my English bros but in soccer, Indian Americans are doing a lot better than the Indians in the UK.</p>

<p>How about Arjun Nimmala? One of the first baseball stars and he is from the US.</p>

<p>I know we are not getting represented that much in sports but the Indians in America are slowly making waves.</p>

<p><strong>Sex appeal and media.</strong></p>

<p>We can talk about Sendhil Ramamurthy who is seen as the gold standard of good-looking Indian guys here in the US.</p>

<p>The Indian guy in cult classic Supertroopers.</p>

<p>Who can forget the iconic Harold and Kumar.</p>

<p>Yes, Indian men do have work to do but man, it seems like compared to elsewhere, Indian men in the US have slowly stepped up over the years as well.</p>

<p>M Night also directed a lot of cool movies.</p>

<p>Then the rise of Hasan Minhaj and how popular he got.</p>

<p>People were crazy for a bit for Manish Dayal.</p>

<p>There is also Hanumankind who spent his formative years in Houston.</p>

<h1>I actually believe that the next wave of Indian Americans is going to dominate big.</h1>

<p>I believe that as Indian Americans assimilate more and more, you are going to get more Indian men in athletics and in acting. I think that at this point, it is only a matter of time. These guys born to rich families are going to pursue acting and sports careers in the future. There are some great things on the horizon.</p>
