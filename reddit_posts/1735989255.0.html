                    <div class="content"><p>So I’m a 19, live with family, commute to college. I have a small circle of friends.</p>

<p>I’ve never drank alcohol in my whole life. Partly due to religion and partly due to my athletic career. I’m a lifter. I’ve been told I look cute and attractive by some girls I know. </p>

<p>I’ve never watched corn in my life. I just heard a few of my classmates talking about it one time. It sounds horrible tbh. </p>

<p>I go to my religious institution like every other week. </p>

<p>Is my dating pool severely restricted? Because it seems like u have to be a total degenerate to date women these days. You have to drink, party, go to clubs, bars etc…</p>

<p>I don’t wanna change my values and beliefs just to pull one of these degenerate chicks. </p>

<p>I went to my friend’s house party once, and this one drunk girl tried to kiss me. I just kinda extended my elbows towards her so as to push her away. Does that make me volcel? </p>

<p>I honestly can’t see myself “dating” until it’s time to marry. I also don’t wanna ever go near alcohol cuzz I’ve seen what it does and because of my religion. </p>

<p>Anyone else in this situation? 
Any advice? </p>
