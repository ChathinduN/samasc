                    <p class="content">After working on myself for material and social gains over the past few years, I recently went to India to visit my family. During my trip, I had an crazy spiritual experience and realised I had been caught in an illusion. Hanging out with my family during the trip helped me feel recentered, but now i'm back home in Australia, feeling lost and distrustful of my surroundings.

I'm now certain that we live in a spiritual plane. Things that I used to care about don't appeal to me anymore.

I want to get married to a girl from my hometown in India and move onto the next stage of life.

I never thought I'd think that thought, especially while still (relatively) young. Plus it would make my mum happy. She's always encouraged me to get married young. I've always brushed her off.

The truth is, after my experience, I'm fearful of what could happen to my children if I raise them in a home without my culture. I don't think i'd be able to provide the spiritual foundation that I had growing up.

Anyone been through something similar? Am I crazy? Will this wear off? Or should I take a leap of faith?</p>
