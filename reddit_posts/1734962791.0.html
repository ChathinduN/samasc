                    <div class="content"><p>Sigh. I can't believe I've let the algorithm bait me into gender and race wars but this one caught my eye. </p>

<p>Take a look at this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDzr5C3OQ_V/">reel</a>. </p>

<p>The long and short of it is that the dude in the video cheated on the chick who posted the reel. Breadcrumbing, curving, whatever. </p>

<p>Let me go ahead and say that I don't care for cheaters.</p>

<p>The comments however, as you may have guessed, immediately harp on Indian men. The usual. How all Indian men are like that, and how you should never date an Indian man. </p>

<p>The ones quickest to jump on the hate train, are of course our very own Indian women. The woman who posted this also went on to like these comments. Because of course only Indian men cheat. Not unlike Italian men who are known for their strict adherence to monogamy.</p>

<p>The dude is some sort of internet celebrity and if he cheated then he is scum (if he was able to cheat with multiple women though...he clearly has something women want lol). His cheating has nothing to do with him being an Indian. </p>

<p>I had to get off the damn app the moment I realized the algorithm got me.</p>
