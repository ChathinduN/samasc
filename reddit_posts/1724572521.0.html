                    <p class="content">In this sub-reddit, I see a lot of Indian males talking about how Indian men are vilified all over the world and how we face racism.   
But no one acknowledges the hate Indian men give to other communities. I am gonna list out a few:  
  
1. Against Korean men: Calling them gay, feminine, trans and what not. 

2. Against Muslims: This is obviously done by mostly Hindu Indian men, but the level of Islamophobia by Indian men is crazy.

3. Against Africans, Sri Lankans: Shaming them for their dark complexion, and even using their identity as a slur to shame other dark Indians.

4. Against Chinese, Nepali, etc.: This racism is so strong that it extends to Nort-eastern Indians as well (directed from mainly North, West and Central Indians).



And No, don't tell that they were the first to start. I have been seeing this since my childhood. Infact, I have myself faced these (eventhough I am Indian). </p>
