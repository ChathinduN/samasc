                    <div class="content"><p>So for those of you who have not had the chance to check it out, my blog is pinned to my profile and I talk about all of my travels this year. I had the chance to go to a ton of different European countries and travel for months due to being on my sabbatical and I went with my Korean American friend. He is 6'1 and jacked and I am 5'10 and in pretty good shape.</p>

<p>After looking back at it, even compared to Eastern Europe, I have to say that France was by far the most fun country we went to. I am going to share some of my observations.</p>

<p><strong>It's freaking beautiful.</strong></p>

<p>Nice and The French Riviera have to be by far the most beautiful places I have gone to in all of Europe. Italy and Spain could simply not stack up at all in terms of beauty. France puts most European countries to bed when it comes to the variety of natural beauty. Go to the border towns like Annecy to get that Swiss mountain vibe or go to Nice to get that feel for Mediterranean beauty. </p>

<p>The vibe is also calming in these places because I did not feel as many scammers or aggressive people like I did in Spain and Italy.</p>

<p><strong>The French are some of the nicer people in Europe.</strong></p>

<p>Yeah Parisiens suck but once you get away from them, the French are nice. They are nowhere near as rude as people from places like Belgium, Spain, Italy, and Switzerland. Overall, I found the French to be some of the nicer people in Europe and even the Parisians are not that bad when you compare them to other European nationalities. The language barrier sucks though.</p>

<p><strong>Food is somewhat underrated.</strong></p>

<p>Maybe it isn't Greek food but it is not English food either in terms of quality. Wines are some of the best in the world and the dishes can be done well. I had chicken in red wine sauce in one town and that really did it for me. There is not that big of a gap between French and Italian food.</p>

<p><strong>There is definitely a market for Indian dudes there.</strong></p>

<p>In no other European country did I feel as fetishized as I did in France, not even in Eastern Europe. I feel like if you look good and are not the stereotype, many women will be into you. The language barrier was a massive cockblock though. Some girls outside of Paris, actually most, cannot speak English at all. It sucks because the best girls in France are usually outside of Paris.</p>

<p>I cannot think of any other country in Europe or really even the world where I felt like as an Indian guy, I had as many come-ons and as many IOIs. Certain white girls there seem to be into our looks for sure but the best part about France is not even just the white girls.</p>

<p><strong>Lots of hot ethnic girls.</strong></p>

<p>Arab, Black, Asian, and even certain Indian and mixed girls. I ran into my fair share of mixed-race girls who seemed to be quite open to me. As usual, mixed girls and ethnic girls will be somewhat easier but I did notice that Mediterranean French women were also quite receptive to me. I did not do as well with blondes in France but I did do a lot better with brunettes, especially if they had more of that Italian look to them.</p>

<p><strong>They are pretty good in bed.</strong></p>

<p>I have slept with a few nationalities and French girls fall into my top 3. It is just that smell they have which is natural but arousing for starters. Then it is their aggression and how free they are in bed too. They seem somewhat toxic though in attitude and I have had some go from jolly to being rude the next morning but still wanting to fuck. I actually talk about their neurotic behavior in my stories.</p>

<p><strong>Lyon was the best city for me.</strong></p>
