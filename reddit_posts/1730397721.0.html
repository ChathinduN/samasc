                    <div class="content"><p>Always date to have fun and know your partner. Never sell yourself as easy to marry despo. </p>

<p>Make sure you know your partner mentally, physically and emotionally before even having a thought about marriage. </p>

<p>Marriage should not be your end goal. It should be companionship and a happy partnership. </p>

<p>Dont sell yourself soo early. Make sure you know the person. Don't be last refuge for disloyal hoes. Who just think you as an last option. </p>

<p>It's better to be single then to be in a insecure relationship. </p>

<p>Buy a dog or a cat if you that lonely. Work for better lifestyle. Relationship is not an end goal in life. It is to be happy. Stay strong brothers.</p>
