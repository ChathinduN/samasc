                    <p class="content">I have always struggled both career/academically and socially all my life. I am autistic and have learning problems. 

I got a 4 year college degree and have been in and out of a few business related jobs over the last few years. I feel I am a disappointment compared to most second gen desi kids and to my father. I am not very smart academically and just tried to do the best I could. I will never live up to the Indian standards for success. That is something I have to make peace with. 

How do I deal with this? 

Can anyone relate or at a similar spot? </p>
