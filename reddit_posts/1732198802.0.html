                    <div class="content"><p>Hanging around desi areas I notice that some of you guys and your drip are on life support üôè. Ima keep this post real short and sweet with niche advice and not the typical smell, clothing, gym bs. </p>

<li>Wear gold- its an aspect of our culture which I absolutely love, theres a reason its so engrained in our culture. Gold just looks great on brown skin, the colours work so well together. Even in big luxury brands this colour combination can be seen</li>
</ol>

<p>An infamous example is Louis Vuitton, every product they have follows this colour scheme</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>Wear more gold- you can never wear too much, Indian gold is also always 22-23kt so it shines really well and stands out. I personally have a chain, a bracelet and a couple rings, I don't usually wear all of these at once but I do for events and things like clubbing. I get compliments on it all the time. People want to know where I buy my gold from since western jewellery shops are more ice focused rather than gold focused (thanks to rap culture). Seriously you guys need to try this. I would post pictures of my pieces but they are custom made so I don't wanna dox myself. (maybe not the best idea if you live in the hood). </p></li>
<li><p>Be considerate of clothing colour- The truth is fashion isn't a one-fit-for-all typa thing, different colours work better with different skin tones although that would probably get me cancelled for saying this. As a dark brownie I personally wear colours from dark blue to tan on the colour wheel if they are of normal tone. For colours outside this range I would wear a deeper tone. For example, I wouldn't wear a bright green outfit, because then I would look like a mint chocolate, I would wear a deep green shade such as the image I have placed below.</p></li>
