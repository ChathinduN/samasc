                    <div class="content"><p>For context I'm an international student in canada from India (ik) and I'm not one of those FOBs who don't want to learn canadian culture.
Another thing is I was an introvert but now I've realised that I should be more outgoing and I think I'm doing a progress in it by just saying hello to other people at work or university and have a few diverse friends from every culture including browns and none of them are racist. But recently whenever I open any comment section of youtube or instagram I just see the same comments which I don't think I need to say and as a result I'm trying to view myself negatively and low self confidence. I just can't talk to any girl outside my culture thinking back in my head that "Oh she hates me" without even talking to her,I'm not to hit on her but as a social conversation. 
I have deleted instagram which helped me a lot but reddit is even more racist especially canadian subreddit but I need reddit for my hobby (this is not my main account). There are few brown influencers that are uplifting but at the same time there is an ocean of influencers trying to drag us down by centuries and most of them are Indians unfortunately. 
I don't know what to expect but I wish all of us south Asians unite to be better and not hate among ourself, like pakistan vs India, south India vs north or those that are literally stealing or blasting loud music (these kind of immigrants make it hard for other immigrants to live) which I Hate also wish we try to assimilate to other culture also I'm aware of the fact that the dislike may be justified but the amount of hate is not right.
Anyway just wanted to share with my south asian brothers and sisters. A bit of light would be nice.
Thanks.</p>
