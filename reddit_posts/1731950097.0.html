                    <div class="content"><p>Growing up as an Asian guy in the West, many of us had no one to guide us through lifeâ€™s challenges. We lacked role models who truly understood our strugglesâ€”people who looked like us and could inspire us to rise above the stereotypes and expectations forced on us.</p>

<p>Bruce Lee was the symbol of what was possible, but heâ€™s been gone for over 50 years. Since then, weâ€™ve been left to figure things out in a world that often refuses to see us. Sure there's been the rising tide of Kpop/Bollywood, but it's still not all that popular in the West. And yeah, we got Simu Liu in MCU's Shang Chi, both their first Asian superhero but also the very first male lead superhero that did NOT get a romantic interest in all of the MCU. </p>

<p>So two steps forward, one step back. This absence of representation has real consequences. It chips away at our confidence, our self-image, and our ability to connect with others, especially in relationships, self-esteem and mental wellness.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why I created this video, <strong>"</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/8peCVZiuejo">Generation Lost: Why Role Models Are Important for Young Asian Men.</a><strong>"</strong> Itâ€™s not just about recognizing the problemâ€”itâ€™s about starting the solution. Asian men can and should step up as leaders, as role models, and as examples of strength and success.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s time to fill the vacuum ourselves. Watch the video and see how weâ€™re breaking down barriers and building the foundation for a stronger future. Letâ€™s show the worldâ€”and ourselvesâ€”what weâ€™re capable of. ðŸ’ª</p>
