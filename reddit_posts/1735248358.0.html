                    <div class="content"><p>For context, I was always pretty skinny despite being active and playing sports from a young age. Was fatter around 11-12 then became skinny again after. In roughly 4 years of working out i grew my arms significantly through the following.</p>

<p>FYI: I'm splitting arms into triceps, biceps and forearms</p>

<p>Another FYI: The information I give is mostly just my own experience, do whatever exercises you enjoy and are going to stay consistent in. I realise now consistency with a decent program is way more important than trying to optimise your workouts while not sticking to the long term plan</p>

<p><strong>Triceps</strong></p>

<p>- Pushups, weighted pushups: Used these before i had access to a bench and weights but these work extremely well for adding strength and mass to your chest, triceps and front delts, only switched to a gym now to gain strength and power in my lower body for sports which is hard to develop with just bodyweight leg workouts, i remember i watched some video saying weighted pushups lead to more tricep growth then bench which was interesting and it's probably true.</p>

<p>- Weighted Dips: Work well for upper chest as well as the triceps, do these with elbows tucked in (similar to a close grip pushups grip width) to maximise tension on the triceps. If you go too heavy you might get pain in the middle of your sternum so warm up well before doing them, don't make the same mistake as i used to.</p>

<p>- Dumbbell bench: Mainly a chest movement but they develop your triceps a decent bit, i like these a bit more then barbell for the deeper stretch for the chest, they reveal any strength imbalances and its way easier to set up with no spotter needed</p>

<p>I stuck with these movements for years and they worked amazing, notice how none of these are isolation movements: I do include isolation movements, I enjoy doing isolation movements, but they were not essential if i did other exercises which heavily involve the triceps (pushups, dips, bench etc)</p>

<p>Isolation Exercises I did ranked in how much I liked them were</p>

<ol>
<li>Tricep overhead extension: Used to do these with a resistance band, now use cable machine, they give a massive stretch to the long head, i enjoy these a lot, if you go heavy, they feel weird for the shoulders so watch out</li>
<li>Tried tricep kickbacks for a few sessions, felt like they were not needed after overhead extensions and my compound exercises, too tired for them as well</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Biceps</strong></p>

<p>- Neutral Grip Pullups: I used to do only overhand pullups but when i switched to neutral grip i stopped getting any weird elbow and shoulder pains, youtube videos i checked out said their healthier for your joints as well. Amazing exercise and one ive been consistent with for a long time.</p>

<p>- Dumbbell curls: Nothing to say here really, they felt good for my arms, did them for a while when working out at home</p>

<p>- Cable curls, do these now with the cable machine mainly since their easier to set up than the barbell curl, feel good on the biceps</p>

<p><strong>Forearms</strong></p>

<p>- Hammer Grip curls: stopped doing these when i started doing neutral grip pullups since its the same target muscles, they felt pretty decent on my wrists compared to underhand curls for some reason, good exercise if you can't do hammer grip pullups</p>

<p>- Pullups with thick grips: Don't buy fatgripz online before trying a towel over the pullup handle or doing towel grip pullups, I feel a decent amount of forearm when doing these after my normal sets of weighted pullups</p>

<p>- Forearm curls: Tried for a few weeks, didn't feel it was worth the extra time</p>

<p>- Using a Hand gripper: EXTREMELY UNDERRATED bit of equipment, find them online for around $10 and you can get good quality, very strong ones from captains of crunch for around $50-80. Used to be consistent with these and forearms grow pretty fast when you work them often. I would recommend buying one. If you go the cheap ones make sure its adjustable with a dial on the side.</p>
