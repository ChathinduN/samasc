                    <p class="content">I am currently overweight, might even be obese. I am looking to shed 10kg in 2 months to look atleast a bit fitter for a wedding. 

I have joined a gym and am looking into portion control and upping my intake of protein.

Is it a good idea to go without food every alternate day (atleast for a couple of weeks) to increase fat loss? I will be drinking ORS solution on days I consume no food.</p>
