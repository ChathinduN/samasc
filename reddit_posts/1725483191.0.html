I think we as desiâ€™s are unaware that they may not be living an acceptable human experience 

In my last post 

I talked about dysfunctional family relationships in a previous post and how that can effect life outcomes. 

One area it may affect is oneâ€™s ability to connect with others. 

In order to connect with someone it helps to be in a state of ease where you can actively listen to someone and be present with them.

Sometimes Racism, cultural incompatibilities, financial security. High Exceptions can interfere with these opportunities of connection.

These moments are important for humans and neglecting this can lead to loneliness and depression and disconnection with oneâ€™s life.

Sometimes I meditate and this helps enjoy others company more

Do you sometimes have difficulty being present with others? What kind of feelings or thoughts have been running in your mind during these moments of connection? Do you have any strategies in this regard?</p>
