                    <div class="content"><p>I’ve been wondering on this personal dilemma for a while. In regard to dating and Hooking up.</p>

<p>I see a lot of people around me casually dating and having experiences, which sometimes makes me wonder if doing so will add to the sex appeal of south asian men.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I want to wait for the right person to share and experience with meaningful connection.</p>

<p>The global image of South Asian men isn’t really as sex idols and I worry that I will indirectly add to this. There are a lot of stereotypes we have to deal with and part of me wonders if indulging more in the dating scene would help break those stereotypes and show people that we’re dynamic, confident, and desirable individuals. </p>

<p>Should I embrace this phase of my life, indulge in new experiences, and not overthink it too much? Or should I save myself for someone who feels like "the one"?</p>

<p>For context, I’m 20, so I’m still young, but I want to make sure I’m making choices that align with who I want to be.</p>

<p>What’s your take on this, especially with the cultural or societal angle? Would love to hear your thoughts.</p>
