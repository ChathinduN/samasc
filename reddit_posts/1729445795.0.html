                    <div class="content"><p>In 2024, I took a sabbatical from work and traveled through Europe with my Korean friend, I wrote about it on my blog pinned to my profile. I did try to post this on Passport Bros but the incel trolls came out and completely wrecked the thread with a lot of hatred towards Indians.</p>

<p>Why Europe? Because it is the only place I extensively traveled to. This might not apply to FOBs who are the stereotype but for the Indian men with their shit together, it is worth the trip.</p>

<p>To determine if it makes sense to put the countries on the list, I looked for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>How good of a time I had there</li>
<li>Whether I met Indian men married to local women that were attractive there</li>
<li>The appreciation for aspects of Indian culture</li>
</ul>

<h1>This might not be completely accurate.</h1>

<p>Only because I went to various countries but have not spent time in all of them, at least not a significant amount. My friends have said places like Estonia, Latvia, and Belarus might be good but I never went. Some say Poland is good but I never went there.</p>

<p>Here are five countries that I believe belong on the list.</p>

<p><strong>Czech Republic.</strong></p>

<p>I heard mixed things about Prague and Czech Republic. In the past, I did hear that they hate Indians there. I went and found the exact opposite. The hatred was reserved for drunk English tourists for the most part. I met Indian men who were married to local women there and had a great time with local women myself. I'd even wager to say that compared to a White guy from England or the Anglo world, an Indian or Asian dude enjoyed a higher ceiling unless said white guy learned the language and completely assimilated. There are definitely women there with a thing for Indian men.</p>

<p>It was one of the few countries where I saw Indian dudes wife up and get with some top-tier women in the looks department.</p>

<p><strong>France.</strong></p>

<p>I am willing to put France above a lot of Eastern European countries, that is how good it is for Indian guys on the dating side. A while ago I believe I read a thread here saying how a poster that went to France saw a lot of IR dating with Indian men involved. In my experience going to places like Lyon, was definitely on point. Knowing the language is a must but French women are fetishists for Indian guys from my experience, more so than Euro women anywhere else.</p>

<p>In a way, there must be something to it. Even in Canada, I found Montreal and Quebec overall to be better for Indian men than Anglo Canada was.</p>

<p><strong>Hungary.</strong></p>

<p>A more laid-back version of Czech Republic. I noticed a big love for Indian culture here and Indian dudes I met here had a decent time with women. I noticed a good reception from Hungarian women themselves and that is great because I love their look (black hair and tanned). Not much to be said other than it was like the Czech Republic but somewhat more laid back.</p>

<p>The only difference is that I notice the hatred towards English and Anglo tourists is a lot lower than it is in Czech Republic. Indian dudes definitely have a market in both countries.</p>

<p><strong>Sweden.</strong></p>

<p>Thing is in Sweden falls more towards neutral territory for me. It is a tough country for game since the average guy is attractive but Indian men I met who assimilated into the culture there do well. Like with a lot of Northern Euro countries, I think Indian men would be better off going for Middle Eastern and Arab girls than white girls. Landing that Scandinavian blonde can be somewhat tough but brunettes are easier.</p>

<p><strong>Germany.</strong></p>

<p>Germany, like Sweden, falls into neutral territory for me. I noticed an easier time with Turkish women and German women who were more brunettes. Blondes seemed to be a lot tougher to get and were a lot more rude, generally speaking. However, the stigma that exists towards Indians in the UK does not exist here. Indian men fall more in the neutral category rather than enjoying kind of exotic boost they would in France, Hungary, or Czech Republic but they are not as stigmatized either like they would be in an England or an Italy.</p>
