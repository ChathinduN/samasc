                    <div class="content"><p>Many younger desi guys ( mostly in high school) message me because they feel hopeless and are in despair. The comments about Indians on tik tok and instagram have taken a tole on their mental health . </p>

<p>Pieces of advice to combat the hopelessness and to start winning in life.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don’t go on social media and if you do follow motivational pages/interest that you like. Don’t just doom scroll.</p></li>
<li><p>Set timers for social media use. I use an app called opal but y’all can use whatever you want. I’ve limited instagram use to 10 mins a day and Reddit use to 15 mins a day. This is important so you don’t just doom scroll and waste your time consuming brain rot content. </p></li>
<li><p>This third step might sound corny AF but hear me out. Create an evidence board for what you want. An evidence board is different than a vision board. Many desi guys, especially in 2024 bcuz of our shitty rep, believe that successfully dating interracially is out of reach because as in the words of one of these high school desi guys who messaged me ( all women hate us).  On the evidence board what you’re gonna put is pictures of desi guys with women who you would want for yourself ( ik this is corny). However, prior to the accomplishment of a goal, you actually have to believe it’s possible if not you’ll never take the action required to actually achieve it. Likewise on the evidence board put pictures of desi guys who have the physiques that you want. This is important, because many guys genuinely believe they can’t get big because of their race/ethnicity. The whole exercise with the evidence board is to shatter limiting beliefs so you can go after your goals.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Taking action towards success.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Schedule everything on google calendar. As the saying goes “ whatever gets measured gets managed”. Likewise you guys gotta be tracking your time on google calendar to see where your time is going ( time is your most valuable asset). </p></li>
<li><p>Track your macros and log everything on something like my fitness pal. Many of y’all claim to not being able to gain weight and will simply blame it on genetics but I can 100% guarantee if we were to actually track what your eating, we would find out that your undereating, hence your lack luster results. </p></li>
<li><p>Quick hack when it comes to food which I use but I know it’s not feasible for everyone. I have a cooking robot called the thermomix ( look it up) so it’s easy for me to cook up delicious food of various cuisines, however the thermomix is expensive for me, personally it cost me around  $1700. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>People who will help you increase your SMV</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A great barber:( many of y’all a good haircut and beard trim away from changing y’all SMV)</p></li>
<li><p>An aesthetician: will help you to achieve glowing skin based on your unique case. Will tailor make a program for you. </p></li>
<li><p>A trainer if needed: this is expensive tbh but some of y’all especially if y’all have the money but lack motivation they’ll serve as accountability partners and will tell you exactly what you need to do in order to attain your desired physique </p></li>
<li><p>An image consultant: If y’all don’t want to seek fashion advice ideas off instagram or watch YouTube fashion channels there’s always the option to simply hire someone to do your wardrobe. This can get expensive, but once again it’s your prerogative how u use ur money.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly, invest in yourself. The downfall of desi men is that many of them are too cheap to invest in bettering themselves/bettering their lives. The best investment that you’ll ever make is in yourself so don’t skimp on it. </p>

<p>Best of luck to y’all</p>
