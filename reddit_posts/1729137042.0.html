                    <p class="content">A lot of these Red pill coaches, self help coaches,  gym bro coaches and Islamic Influencers (no hate to any Muslim bros in general) are using ragebait on social media to target hate on Indians leading to street crimes bring acceptable too. 

It is like they just don't know what to say and choose to hate on Indians cause it is socially acceptable.  All of them are just course selling or street interviewing punters. 

Way too much time and attention is being wasted on them. Shall we keep an active report thread like Rajat Twins to take them down?</p>
