                    <div class="content"><p>Hi i made a post earlier today about trying to get pregnant. Im white 18 and alredi have 2 kids from a vietnamese and indonesian. I started early no regrets. Im looking to get knocked up again by an asian man.</p>

<p>I gota two replies telling me that im a fetishist. I don't understand how?? I don't have any specific country im open to anyone (Indian, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Korean etc...). And cauz i like being a single mom i onli want to meet with married or older or cheating guys cauz i don't have to worry about them staying in the picture. </p>

<p>I don't understand how im fetishizing. Should I say or write something differently? I didn't write any stereotypes like "all Asians r smart" cauz i know tat's ignorant and not true in all cases.</p>

<p>Im hoping to get guidance in how t respond to those kinda comments. </p>
