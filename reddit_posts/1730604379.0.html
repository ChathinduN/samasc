                    <div class="content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Most of us were born from a culture which glorifies arranged marriages and starting families. The same culture often promotes reproduction beyond the level of wealth needed to sustain a healthy standard of living--In other words, babies were historically born at high rates in countries where the poverty level didn't improve at a rate that was proportional to the population growth, resulting in an endless cycle of poverty and inadequate health.</p>

<p>But this post is actually for the adult male diaspora in developed countries. South Asian diaspora are good at 2 things: Getting money and raising stable families. However, the economic and political climate is changing in the West, and there are emerging reasons to stay childless. Of note, FOBs in America, despite being high IQ and high-earning, tend to be blissfully unaware of how American politics and the economy work on a very deep level, and how they affect familial relationships and parenting.</p>

<h1>Why I Write This Post</h1>

<p>2 reasons:</p>

<p>Firstly, I knew an American-born desi woman who was highly educated and financially successful but was approaching age 40 and couldn't find a husband. She had several symptoms of a Cluster B personality disorder which is why men avoided her. Her coworkers of all races despised her because she was lazy, manipulative, and toxic (just picture Aparna from "Indian Matchmaking" but much louder and more unstable). She finally married a 40-year-old desi guy that she met at work who, despite also being high-earning, was clearly a loser but desperate for a desi wife. So now you have a newlywed couple of two American-born-confused-desi 40-year-old virgins with zero relationship experience and inadequate social maturity. She still wants to have kids. For social and biological reasons, it's obvious that her future kids aren't guaranteed a good life.</p>

<p>The second reason is the crazy family homicide attempts in California in the past year, whose stories are linked <a href="https://people.com/crime/calif-doctor-accused-of-driving-tesla-off-cliff-with-wife-and-children-inside-pleads-not-guilty/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/san-mateo-murder-suicide-former-indian-american-meta-engineer-shoots-wife-4-yr-old-twins-before-killing-himself-101707925769141.html">here</a>. These 2 fathers both tried killing their families, due to being unable to handle their own life stressors and their poor mental health, and they were clearly unprepared for the additional stress of raising a family. One of them appears to have succeeded and murdered his entire family--To top it off, this seemed like a FOB Catholic family, so these tragedies can happen to anyone. For both fathers, the choice to have kids was clearly not a well-thought-out decision.</p>

<p>Mark My Words: <strong>Domestic violence will slowly rise in the coming years for many South Asian families</strong>, especially now that we have a rapid influx of high-earning South Asian men who all want to enter the rat race and pursue the American dream in its entirety while being underprepared for their relationship dynamics. It's no longer enough to have money. A man must also be able to introspect and analyze his ability to self-manage his mental health, as well has have a deep understanding about the American economy and its effects on male-female relationships and families. Some Indian-Americans (especially those who weren't raised here) are unaware of these harsh realities, confidently believing that they are superior to whites because they've already figured out how to make money and blindly assume that because they are wealthy, their future wives and kids will be safe, and it inevitably leads to family problems down the road that they aren't prepared to handle.</p>

<p><strong>If you aren't 100% confident in your ability to manage your own mental and physical health, then you cannot manage a relationship. And if you can't manage a relationship, then there's no way you can manage a family</strong>. <strong>Th</strong>ere's a clear order of flow in these 3 requirements and many South Asians, especially fresh immigrants, ignore this hierarchy completely -- They skip to the 3rd step and start popping out babies as soon as they get money. They don't grasp that there's a lot more to the decision to have kids than just having good finances. They put trust in their time-tested traditional social structures to save the day, but as we all know, these social structures are highly prone to collapse when you're living in the wealthiest nation on Earth. An entire post can be written on this concept alone.</p>

<h1>Other Reasons To Not Have Kids</h1>

<p><strong>A) Many of you want kids for selfish reasons and you just haven't realized it yet:</strong> Maybe your parents said that it's your duty to continue your bloodline, or that it's "nice to raise your own progeny who look just like you." Or maybe you've attained enough success in life to bring out your inner masculine urge to procreate. These reasons aren't immoral, but they are selfish in a philosophical sense. Sure, it'll feel great to have offspring who admire you and look like you and are excited to see you come home from work each day. But you should realize that as they grow up, their lives will not be molded in the way that you want. Children are not like dogs who will obey your every command and become the adults you want them to be. And when they become teenagers, they'll rebel against you and carve their own paths, just as you did with your own parents. And sure, it may feel good to be the man of the house, but in this day and age, it's becoming increasingly tough to navigate the balance between being that traditional patriarch and accepting modern sensibilities, and I don't think most South Asian men have thought about this prior to starting a family, especially the 2 aforementioned fathers in California. <strong>Deep introspection is not really encouraged in desi communities.</strong></p>

<p><strong>B) You cannot guarantee that your children will live a better life than you</strong>. Just because you live in a wealthy country does not mean that your children have a reasonable likelihood of meeting or exceeding your own level of health and life satisfaction. Sociopolitically, a lot has changed since you were a kid:</p>

<ol>
<li>Anxiety and depression rates in teens have gone up.</li>
<li>There's a pathologic push to give puberty blockers and transgender treatments to minors.</li>
<li>The average American IQ keeps dropping because dumb people have more babies than smart people, which means more bullying will take place in schools because bullies are usually low IQ, and your child could become a victim of bullying.</li>
<li>Inflation and housing prices both continue to outpace wage growth.</li>
<li>And for the same economic reasons, parents are forced to spend less time with their kids.</li>
<li>There's still no gun control or solution to all the public mass shootings.</li>
</ol>

<p>...and the list goes on and on.</p>

<p><strong>C)</strong> Lastly, this is a less important reason, but a tiny minority of you have genes that should not be passed on, and you know who you are: As developing nations become wealthier, their people become more superficially judgmental, and a man's phenotype becomes a bigger determinant of his ultimate status and wealth. Yes, genetic shortcomings can be overcome with enough hard work, but if you knew that your son was going to be 4'11'' and balding with high myostatin, insulin resistance, and propensity to mental illness, then why would you bring him into this world and force him to work so hard just to compete with every other man for the same goals? How can you possibly interpret your decision as not being selfish?</p>

<p>On the same note, <strong>there's nothing wrong with adopting</strong>. A ton of great kids in orphanages are just waiting to be adopted into a loving family. You can still bring love and happiness into a child's life even if you didn't create that child.</p>
