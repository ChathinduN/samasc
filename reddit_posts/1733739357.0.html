                    <div class="content"><p>I'm not Desi but since I'm mixed from SEA but born and lived my whole life in a white majority country most people think that I come from South Asia. It frustrates me, not because of the fact that I have to correct them but more of the feeling of being undesired and negative perceptions and prejudgement towards light brown looking people.</p>

<p>And since 90% of my approached end up in rejections I think it is true that Asians, especially South Asians are the least desired group of men. First I never believed in such studies but since I experienced to much rejection I believe that this is true.</p>

<p>Compared to my white friend, who ofc also faced rejection but he had much more success and got invited to parties and festivals with the women he just met couple of days ago. I never had such experiences and mostly get ignored/rejected in the first 10 seconds.</p>

<p>That made me thinking that  I believe that most people are not racist, there is still a lot of subconscious racism based on judgements people make in the first 5 seconds when the interaction starts. I think that is the reason why women are more open/friendly towards my white friend when they get approached.</p>

<p>I have an appointment with my dermatologist soon and ask if there is a treatment to make my skin more whiter. And I try consider to get bald to look less Asian.</p>

<p>It's not only dating but I feel in general, also service workers are friendlier towards white people than to people of colour.</p>
