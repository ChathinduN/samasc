                    <div class="content"><p>Just so you know there are lots of racists and bots looking through this community to find things to stigmatize us about/paint us in a bad light.  </p>

<p>There will be more 'Indians' proclaiming that they are one of us, while pushing ideas that are genuinely harmful, especially in the long-term.</p>

<p>Just thought I'd make everyone aware of this fact.</p>

<p>We should look to make a smaller closed group.</p>

<p>I am thinking of creating a group chat, on a private messaging app.</p>

<p>If anyone has any suggestions (I know whatsapp and telegram are tainted), let me know.</p>
