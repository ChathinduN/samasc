                    <div class="content"><p>Hey there, hope you guys are having a good weekend and apologies for the shitass title.</p>

<p>I'm in the UK as a post grad student and basically lived all my life in bum fuck no where in India before. I've enjoyed my mom's food pretty much all my life (more so back in the covid times) and I've been trying to recreate the same magic lately and looks like I'm getting there.</p>

<p>The thing is though, I smell. I never looked at it that way before actually. Here I am, in my dorm room being shirtless and all, looking like that "this is america" guy, ruminating on going full on yogi vemana mode, thinking "why this room feels so damn stuffy no matter how much I ventilate it". And then, I found about dehumidifiers which made quite a lot of sense and been thinking why I didn't care about such a thing since then.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's one thing rectified but the main thing is that my underarms are just soo fiery. I didn't even bother thinking a lick about them up until today. I was primarily having western and east asian food all this time and just recently started to go all out on my Indian food and it all clicked to me just like that. Back in India, I thought underarms being fiery and all is only natural, thinking it has to do with the temps over there but no, I get it now; it's the spices.</p>

<p>Now, do I want to quit eating Indian curry? NO WAY! And that's where I need your help. I've been sniffing my armpits left and right like the degenerates on the internet and the left one smells like... vinegar? So, that one's out of the question (I was thinking that it might be a remedy) and now I'm left with salicylic and glycolic acids. Also, what deodorants do you guys recommend, I prefer something that's subtle I guess. (I've been using basic talcum powders all my life)   </p>

<p>I used salux cloth before and I've been thinking of taking the same route again, how are you guys exfoliating? Is there any better way to exfoliate your skin and do you guys have anything else to recommend that could improve this FOB's quality of life - things I might have been blindsided to all this while because of my middle class, rural existence.</p>

<p>Any tips on writing or just language in general is appreciated as well and thanks for taking the time to stop by.</p>

<p>TL;DR: armpits on fire, pits stinky, need help</p>
