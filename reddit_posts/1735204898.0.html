                    <div class="content"><p>I've been lifting seriously with a solid diet, 1.6g/kg protein, plenty of sleep and a solid training regime for a year now. Not seeing a lot of gains. I've literally done every little thing right and constantly sought out quality information (Renaissance Periodization), worked with trainers and more. But my weights are stagnant, low and i'm barely putting on muscle. Recently my leg days have been exclusively on like step downs, bridges etc. with a trainer because my knees just hurt like hell doing any kind of squatting motion. Also have some niggling shoulder issues with chest press. Other exercises like rows where I don't have any pains/issues have been stuck at the same weights for months - i don't feel any stronger. I'm taking plenty of protein and creatine daily as well. From all sources, i'm supposed to be having incredible beginner gains, but instead i have like barely any gains at all.</p>

<p>It really is genetics at this point. I don't want to argue about it or turn this into some political discussion. I want to hear from other indian guys who've had significant success in building a muscular physique or getting up to high weights in the gym. What worked for you? What didn't work? How did you get past plateaus? How should training be adapted specifically for indian physiques?</p>
