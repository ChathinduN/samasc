                    <p class="content">Why are we so desperate for validation as South Asian men? All these posts latch on to white women and their approval of us and western society’s general approval of us as signs of success. Do you know how much you have to hate yourself to attach yourself to such uncontrollable matters. And to be honest I don’t even think white women or western society gives a fuck either way, we’re just so neurotic about it.</p>
