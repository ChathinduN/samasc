<p>These are all recent TikTok’s I’ve been seeing all over my fyp and also there’s tons of “the great shift” comments under any attractive brown persons random TikTok’s. And most fo the comments agreeing too that it’s happening </p>

<p>CONTEXT: “The great shift” was basically a phenomenon where before like 2016 darkskins (black dudes) couldn’t pull to save their lives and girls did not like them at all and the light skins has the most pull for sum reason and randomly it shifted to like darkskins and dreadheads etc.</p>

<p>CURRENT SITUATION:</p>

<p>So basically the consensus is that the great shift is happening right now for Indians and basically people are actually realizing that Indians are actually attractive etc(both guys and girls). Essentially what will happen if this actually happens is we’re gonna get fetishized like how Latinas are for example.(I’m not saying this is a good thing or that we need this lol but it’s better to have a good rep than a bad one and if that means being fetishized then so be it)
And this was lowk huge cuz the way black dudes r fetishized rn is crazy ppl r just sheep and they follow the herd. We’re up next</p>

<p>WHAT WE NEED TO DO:</p>

<p>If u watch the first TikTok I linked the dude in the end talks about what needs to happen for the great shift to actually take place again and it’s that a couple good looking brown boys have to go viral. It’s already started we need to keep it going here are some examples I been seeing of viral brown guys with comment sections full of thirsty ass women 😂:</p>

<p>https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSjQSd9eE/</p>

<p>(There’s many more these are just a few examples)</p>

<p>All we gotta do is push the narrative and it’ll happen. We just gotta promote good looking brown boys and since ppl just hop on the bandwagon we will be the new “shiny thing”(also since we’ve never been fetishized a good looking brown guy is seen as like very exotic which just adds to it, I’ve also seen so many dudes be compared to Aladdin prince naveen etc). I’m already seeing the majority of gen z brown ppl putitng #greatshift in their captions on unrelated TikToks they’re really tryna manifest this</p>

<p>TAKING ACTION : </p>

<p>Like I said before it’s happening but we need some catalysts we need to push the narrative by promoting good looking brown boys on titktok while relating it to the “great shift” and I know this will 100% work and spread crazy fast just like the “what race would u not date” or “why did u redeem” thing did cuz ppl on the internet are just trend followers. Essentially we just have to push TikTok’s talking about to the great Indian shift while showcasing good looking ones and it will be a big trend.</p>

<p>SO if any one of u have skills editing or making TikTok’s hit my dms i have many examples of things we can push cuz sure the viral TikTokers will continue posting but the random moggers ppl don’t even know and just show up in some random haircut vids etc won’t so we need to do it for them. It’s the cityboyjj playbook just glaze yourself enough and other ppl will start glazing you too. We can make a group and get to work. (Also btw every other race already does this like “omg abgs 😍 “ or “edgars 😍 “ and shows examples etc. )now it’s our time.</p>

<p>It’s mostly Americans and ppl form the uk talking about this and it’s well known that the rest of the world just follows the opinions of America like if Americans think xyz = attractive then the rest of the world will follow which is good cuz Indians are truly worldwide we have significant diasporas in a lot fo countries us uk Canada South Africa aus nz Caribbean counties Europe uae etc so this can be a global thing</p>

<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>If this happens we’re gonna be on top cus the majority of us are already rich and tall etc. one comment I saw described it perfectly and it said “Indians played the long game” saying we focused on school at first then got rich and then focused on image had glow ups etc and played it perfectly.</p>

<p>TLDR
.great shift is happening where ppl are starting to fetishized Indians<br />
.we need some catalysts to speed up the process and carry the momentum
.ppl interested in contributing hmu and let’s run ts</p>
