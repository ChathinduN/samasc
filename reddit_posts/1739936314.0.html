                    <div class="content"><p>I, 18M, have always been a good kid; despite a mishap or two with some girls that my parents found out about, I haven't given any reason for them to restrict me. I've always been a good student, excelled in leadership roles, developed my speaking ability, both urdu and english; I was the cousin your parents compared you to.</p>

<p>We shifted to Canada last year, all of us, for MY university. My sisters, both in different cities, were made TO SHIFT to us, to live together. It has been ridiculous; my father lives overseas, so it's absolute chaos. The sisters bitch and fight with everyone including each other, but are too afraid to open their mouths against someone who isn't direct family. My mother works like a dog in the house, with cooking and cleaning, and gets no help. Then there's me. I have curfews on me. I have eyes on me. I have the freedom to do nothing. It is terrible. Of course, I feel for my mother and try to help her out as much as I can, but I feel I have the right to be a little selfish and feel for myself as well. Coming to Canada, my personality has been destroyed; I'm less confident, I'm shy infront of people, I can't find words to say, I am no longer charming to women. I only realized all this once I pursued leadership roles in my second year after recovering mentally from multiple things in my first year. My sisters try to impose restrictions on me, my mother imposes, my grandmother imposes, and my father agrees with them. My father also talks to me disrespectfully in family calls, which does not help my case at home. I unfortunately blame my father; living away from my sisters were the best years of my life, but he's forced us to live together, and he forces me to give in to them; it's like a pressure cooker, and I am expired meat. What do I do? How do I solve this?</p>
