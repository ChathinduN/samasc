                    <div class="content"><p>Pretty much the title. The whole fuccin swiping meta is dying out. People getting really really tired of that bs. <strong>Women</strong> are <strong>leaving</strong> the dating apps in <strong>droves</strong>. Hence those apps are like 70% men and just 30% women. Just a big fuccin <strong>sausage</strong> <strong>fest</strong>.  When the women leave the dating apps pretty much everyone leaves.</p>

<p><strong>Match group's stock price</strong> (the company that owns all the dating apps) is <strong>down 70% since its peak in 2021-2022.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What does this mean for your dating life? Well it means that you are going to have to get your in person rizz up. You'll actually have to start trying harder to pull irl and meet girls irl.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Places to meet women in 2025:</strong></p>

<p>* Car meet ups (cuz I'm a car enthusiast)</p>

<p>* Cafes</p>

<p>* Run clubs or sporting clubs (pickle ball comes to mind)</p>

<p>* Cooking classes</p>

<p>* Religious institutions</p>

<p>* At Work (just be careful)</p>

<p>* School (duh)</p>

<p>* Cold approaching at malls</p>

<p>* Hobby communities like some y'all like board games and shii</p>

<p>* Cultural Events</p>

<p>* <strong>This one's the best: Through friends! It's called social circle maxxing.</strong></p>
