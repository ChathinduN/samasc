                    <div class="content"><p>There are 3 names below, apart from being women, they have one similarly.</p>

<p>1) Deepika Biswas, North 24 Pargana, WB</p>

<p>2) Vinodhini, Thiruvallur, Tamilnadu</p>

<p>3) Sreekutty, Kollam, Kerala</p>

<p>So, here are the sources of the names I had mentioned above.</p>

<p>So by these links, you all know that these women had been arrested under the POCSO Act for crime against minor boys.
And if you think why the list is not longer, then the answer is, for the rest of the cases, the articles didn't mention the names of the criminals. But that doesn't mean that there are only three cases in India like these, there are more. E.G. -

<p>Now you can see clearly, there are the cases where we cannot get the name of the criminals.</p>

<p>Now, somebody can talk 'What about male perpetrators?' , and here I say that I don't even undermine them. Yes, they exist, in alarming numbers, and for them women are not safe in India. But for them, some matriarchs and whiteknights blabber those annoying narratives like 'Always a Man', 'Men need just one thing' etc. So here are the proofs that these narratives are not true at all. Somebody needs to show the other side of the coin too, and I did that, and anybody could do the same.</p>

<p>If you are bothered about statistics, then here are some stuffs I have to mention:</p>

<p>1) In India, there are no proper statistics for either adult male victims or female criminals involved in sexual crime.</p>

<p>2) In the case of the USA in 2022, as per the source-</p>

<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/418470/number-of-perpetrators-in-child-abuse-cases-in-the-us-by-sex/</p>

<p>The female criminals outnumbers here.</p>

<p>3) In India, the percentage of male child victims under POCSO has gone beyond 50% as per 2007 MoWCD data(I've lost the link now).</p>

<p>4) In the USA, as per NISVS 2010-12 statistical report, there were 1.27 million female victims and 1.486 million male victims of sexual crime(Rape + Made/Forced to Penetrate) at the time taken for survey. And in case of 'Made to Penetrate' (sexual crime with only male victim, I don't know why US lawmakers didn't consider it as Rape), as per report by CDC, approx 78.5% of these crimes involve female perpetrators.</p>

<p>So here's some notes from me-</p>

<p>1) Start accepting the bitter fact that, women too commit these types of crime, and almost at the same rate in comparison with male perpetrators.</p>

<p>2) In the case of Deepika Biswas, most of the common news outlets(Bangla platforms like ABP, and almost all English news portals) suppressed that incident. So, in order to make people aware about severity, we should discuss these as we do when male perpetrators are involved.</p>

<p>3) For women only, if you see any woman committing any such crime on anyone anywhere, even if she is touching someone inappropriately, treat her in the same way like you might do with a male criminal. Because for ethical and legal reasons, we men cannot retaliate against these vile witches in that way. If we had provision to retaliate in an appropriate way, then I could resist that student of 'Ethiraj College for Women' who was rubbing her leg against mine inside a bus in Chennai.</p>

<p>4) Accept that boys and men too, have consent, they don't want 'one thing' always, and ignoring male consent is crime, not any romantic approach as entertainment media shows. Some people may remember, when Swami Vivekananda was in the USA, several religious figures sent some women to molest him to demolish his dignity. He tried hard to made them reluctant to do such things, and later the women confessed the reason.</p>

<p>5) If any boy or man express his experience where he was a victim of any sexual crime by women, please don't make fun of that. When I was in 10th standard, I was groped by a girl in a place like Belur Math, and she was with her mother maybe! In the same year, I was stalked by adult women for a long time in Kolkata Science City. When I vented those to my mother, she just made fun by saying that maybe they were trying to hit on me in this way, what the hell !</p>

<p>6) If you don't have a proper argument, then don't blabber with whatabouteries, cliche narratives. We men are not ignorant about crimes against girls and women by men and men and boys by men. But when we see some women committing crime against men and boys, most of us either remain indifferent, or make fun of victims. Even if you consider my opinion as a part of any so-called Gender War, then also remember that it's not between men and women, it's between narratives. And if you consider me as one spending time in this 'War' instead of doing any other stuff, then okay, I'll choose the war over disgrace.</p>

<p>7) Men here, please raise your voice for yourselves too. We all have protested against womens' issues, and it's a part of our duty. Then why are we ignoring our own issues? As compared to womens' issues, the outrage for mens' issues aren't enough to make any significant changes to curb the problems, otherwise the news editors wouldn't dare to hide the identity of the female perpetrators, and you all identify the similarity among the names I had mentioned more easily. A loud bomb is always necessary to cure a deaf ear, isn't it? You can see women like Deepika Narayan Bharadwaj and Nandini Bhattacharjee are also fighting for mens' rights, then why are you still reluctant?</p>

<p>8) If you can remember, in 2022, a married man was walking on Kapurthala Road, Jalandhar, Punjab. He was abducted and raped by four women. If you wonder why there are not more cases covered in news media for proper awareness, it is because those news don't fetch them TRP or other engagement stuff, the government doesn't consider rape on adult male by women is a crime, and entertainment media makes fun of it by films like 'Great Grand Masti'. And as a result, most of you couldn't know that women can molest/harrass/grope/rape men and boys, and the male victim always experience fatal trauma. Even if we admit that men and boys can be victims by women too, we mostly call them 'lucky'(due to another false narrative that men and boys can barely get female attention). We don't do the same with female victims, and we should not do that, and that's why we shouldn't make fun of male victims too.</p>

<p>9) If you think that Patriarchy is the root why most men are reluctant to talk about this type of crime, then don't make an excuse by this 'Patriarchy' narrative if you think that the evil system is only 'by the men, of the men, for the men'. Women of old times were also equally responsible. Raja Rammohan Roy's mother sued him when he was opposing Sati Pratha. Many women treated a girl child badly during those times. Begum Rokeya was supported by her husband Sakhawat Hossain, a man, but not by any woman from her family. If you point at 'Lack of Formal Education' to defend the reluctance of women from fighting womens' right, you're still making excuses. During the early modern age of India, tribes without formal education were fighting against British Rule, but most women from mainstream society didn't realise that they needed to fight for Feminism. The strongest ever Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi was from that time when Patriarchy was more severe, but still she didn't lost courage.</p>

<p>10) For all genders here I'm saying, the male victims could be your brother, father, friend, boyfriend, husband and even son, right? The government of India has no proper statistics about either adult male victims or female perpetrators. Then why are you reluctant to cry out for male victims just for an excuse of lack of statistical data? Such crime can ruin a boy's childhood adolescent life, can make a man gynophobic, and can destroy a man's healthy marital life. Is this what you want?</p>
