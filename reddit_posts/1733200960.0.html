                    <div class="content"><p>I was scrolling through YouTube and I came across a video by a creator named Lakshya Chaudharyy on the topic “Racism against Indians”. That video honestly led me to dive deeper into the subject matter. </p>

<p>Some of the points that he mentioned and that I agree with are 
- Most Indians are yappers and brag about the smallest things. 
- Indians lie a lot about their history. There is no denying that India has a glorious and one of the major contributions to shaping today's world, however, how does it contribute to today's society? Why do we hold so much pride when the continent is in shambles? 
- Indians' obsession with white skin is out of the roof. Let's be honest, we all have seen those crazy mainland videos where people surround white people and click pictures with them just because they are white. It also applies to the dating market. You will always see white men talking about how easy it is to get laid in India as women throw themselves all over the most mid-looking white bloke. God forbid a brown girl gets a white bf, they will turn this entire dynamic into a social media career. The same goes the other way around, Indian men make white women some sort of goddess. It's disgusting and disrespectful to your entire fucking community. Don't get me wrong it is okay to date outside your race or community but don't make it your entire personality. 
- Indian audiences worship the worst white creators. Some of the examples mentioned in the video are - speed, Mr Beast, Logan Paul and KSI. The same applies to a lot of other creators who react to anything Indian to get millions of views. Why do we need foreign validation? You will never see some Vietnamese dude trying to bootlick these dirty creators who do not have any moral values. 
These are some of the points which brainfucked me!
