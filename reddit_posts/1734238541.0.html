                    <div class="content"><p>I don’t know how many times I have to go over this, but money will only buy you gold diggers who will leave you when the money is gone, and a lot of you guys tried to argue with me saying that money does buy attraction, like don’t get me wrong, money is important, but you can’t have that being the only thing going for you. Like most brown dudes are not bad looking, they just need better grooming and fashion and hygiene, and the height is relatively average-tall due to many young brown folks getting taller(me being 5’11 myself). I can understand a really facially deformed or grotesque looking or very short guy having to use money, but if you are a brown man who is funny, charismatic, charming, and have good social/flirting skills, you should be good. But if you deliberately or unintentionally use money or flaunt your wealth to attract women, don’t be surprised when she leaves you and wants nothing to do with you, not to mention, flaunting your wealth can make you a target, I don’t ever want you mfs to end up like the guy she’s talking about in the video: </p>
