                    <p class="content">I posted a body progress pic and am absolutely in smiles at how awesome and supportive everyone has been (sorry for the click-bait sounding title)!

Often times we are told to think or we just act negatively of not only ourselves but each other. 

I am 100% convinced that the level of support and genuine love that was shown in that thread is EXACTLY how we can lift each other up and be our best as a community. 
You guys are absolutely wonderful and that shit punched me right in the feels. ❤️</p>
