                    <p class="content">I usually have things I like to do during  the week like yoga, basketball, table tennis. 

During these events I try to meet one new person and find out something about them and share something my experience about that topic. Can range from work, to health (gym, new recipes etc) to their social life( are they introverted extroverted). Usually this spins off into other interesting topics.

Iâ€™ll keep repeating this process and then i organically meet new people and then I may be invited to other social events from then vibe with someone and we can hang out some other time.

People I meet this way are for the most part genuine friends because you met them in such a healthy set of circumstances. Doing something you enjoy. More likely to align with goals and values. 

This is how I develop a healthy and supportive social network </p>
