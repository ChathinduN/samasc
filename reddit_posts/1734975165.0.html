                    <div class="content"><p>As south asians we generally don't have the best sleeping habits and this is massively influenced by our culture</p>

<p>Parties where your told to come at 8pm don't start serving food until 10:30 while you wont see the dessert until nearly 12am. Me and you are inside a culture heavily biased towards the late hours of the night for all social events</p>

<p>But it doesn't have to be this way for most of the year</p>

<p>For most of the year you can develop strong sleep hygiene and fall asleep relatively early while having some late nights to spend time with family and friends</p>

<p>But set the baseline as sleeping early and the exception being those late-night dinner parties, not the other way around.</p>
