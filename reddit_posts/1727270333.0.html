                    <p class="content">Do I go to frat parties- hell yea, I've been to two. Would I join a frat?- prob not. Yes I've meet some chill frat guys but I've meet frat guys who are racist af and are douchebags and who have sexist views. I be seeing them make r\*pe jokes all the time. I mean the frats I be going to, I be seeing mad Indians there. In fact last two times that I went I saw an Indian uncle in his mid 40s (abcd) as dj. The college that I be going to parties at got plenty of Indians who are into all that. I got with a white 10/10 sorority girl once and it felt amazing. Ik some Indian frat dudes who are mad chill and who are part of all that and some Indian girls who are in sororities. My college (mostly black and spanish and hood) got this one frat full of black, indian, asian and spanish dudes, most chillest guys I've meet. I go to their events sometimes.

Thing is most of the douchebag racist frat and soriority people I've meet are usually in PWIs. The ones that are in diverse colleges usually are chill.</p>
