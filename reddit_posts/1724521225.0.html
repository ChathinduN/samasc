                    <p class="content">I wanted to give a shoutout to u/kerala_abcd for posting good soccer content on this sub. As a soccer fan, it kind of hurts me to turn on to watch the games on a weekend and then come to realize that there are no South Asian players tearing it up. In a way, I am surprised. I would think that with the high amounts of Desis in the UK who have been there for far longer than their American and Canadian counterparts, we would get at least one. When you factor in how some of these dudes are working class, I would think by now we would have had a brown brother play for the top-tier Premier League clubs.

For all I know, maybe tons of decades ago before the internet, there were alpha Desis playing futbol but I am talking about the future now.

**This is why I believe that the world's first great footballer of Indian origin will come from....**

**THE UNITED STATES.**

When you look at how some MLS teams like San Jose and Dallas already have Desis on their youth squads, something great EPL teams do not have, it seems encouraging. Then you see how UCLA, which is a great college soccer team, has Indian players on it, it is encouraging.

I actually believe that the world's first great footballer, at least in the age of the internet, is going to come from the US and not the UK. 

The reason I say this is because UK Desis had decades, if not even a century more to produce a world-class talent, and outside of some average outliers, they failed to do so. 

I think that in the future, the US will continue to get better at soccer. You already have Americans buying up Premier League Teams including the owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars who is of Pakistani heritage buying one. At some point, I think that this will eventually lead to more Americans playing in the EPL and some of them will turn out to be of Indian heritage.

Given the trends, I actually believe that American Desis will beat their counterparts in the UK in terms of giving the world its first great footballer of South Asian background. 

I do believe that the failure of UK Desis has to be studied in this regard. Of course, discrimination plays a role but I think that collectively, they have not done enough.</p>
