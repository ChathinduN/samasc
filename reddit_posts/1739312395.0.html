                    <div class="content"><p>To cut to the point. For the past year or so, l've been lying to my parents about my situation at university-and it started after covid. I'll admit that I don't have the best academic record especially for electrical engineering; but after covid I went on &amp; off probations ultimately landing on 12 month subscription &amp; possibility of not able to return to complete of whatever is left of my degree (2 yrs of courses left). I've lied so much out of fear &amp; judgement that they think I'll graduate this spring, which is simply not the case.
Obviously I've posted about this multiple times &amp; see the same answers. But After years of neglecting myself &amp; been stubborn, l've decided to consult a therapist (not officially talked to one, need to get a job before I do that so I can pay for it) but I'm scared to tell them the truth &amp; deep down feel ashamed of the situation that l've put myself in. And scared to move forward.</p>

<p>I know how important education is in our South Asian community. So much so I haven't lived for me as I was under the false impression of I can do everything I want once I have my degree- never traveled with the boys or never did anything I liked.
But now I won't get it I doubt I'll be doing anything any time soon. </p>

<p>So any advice for those went to thru some similar or any thing would help.</p>
