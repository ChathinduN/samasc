                    <p class="content">Guys you need to realize this side of things:

There is an evolutionary purpose to finding disgust in other races. It helps prevent disease from first contact but also the many forms of unique bacteria to a region of people that takes much closer mingling to transmit.

It is remarkable what white people are doing against racism in my opinion. America is leading the way in how to live as a melting pot and with almost no questions asked the collective idea is to strive forward to a harmonious world of including all people.

You understand there are bacterias that a desi body has evolved to live with, handle and not even notice that a caucasian body has not? On top of the physiology, many and you can say almost all aspects of a region's specific diet and cooking style is to deal with the native bacterias and parasites. Northern europe's "bland" food is due to the lack of parasitic and bacterial threat. It's heroic honestly considering they very well may get the shortest end of the stick when it's all said and done because their physiology is not evolved to handle these contaminants.

What is not talked about is the bacteria. Many are undiscovered or not as directly symptomatic as H. pylori and others but have more effects on other races, especially white people, than of people from the native region. Nutrient digestion, brain fog, sleep issues...

Desi is definitely considered a top intelligence group right now and there is a feeling of threat, but at least understand it is not an easy road in the present.

Little shit little kids with iphones and pos heartbroken girls on tinder is not a good metric to thinking white men hate you
