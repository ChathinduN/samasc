                    <p class="content">I am curious about this. I have been to Canada before (earlier this year) and found Toronto city (not GTA) as pretty nice. Now, I didn't have time to visit Montreal, which is strange since it was pretty near so that is why I am wondering if someone can give me some insight on that city and state/province as a whole for someone like me?</p>
