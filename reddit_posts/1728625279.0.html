                    <p class="content">Curious, I have to live in Canada for some years before I move with my parents to the states. I am curious about Canadians here who are trying to navigate through this online (at-times irl hate) against desis. Personally I haven't experienced this but then I live in BC.

How are the desi dudes navigating dating in Toronto and in other big cities. I sometimes see random reels of "what race you wouldn't date" and sometimes Indian is said. There was some middle east chick who said that.

So, how are y'all holding up? I can't wait to move back to USA permanently (I was there before) once my GC is approved but I have to be here till that time. What would you advise?</p>
