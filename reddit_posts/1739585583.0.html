                    <div class="content"><p>Hello guys. I thought this would be the best place to ask... considering the following cities:</p>

<p>Austin</p>

<p>Houston</p>

<p>Dallas</p>

<p>Fort Worth</p>

<p>Between these, which one would you recommend for someone in their 30s? I know I have heard bad stories (and good stories) for each of these cities. Austin can be pretty bad, or I have heard it can be good. I was planning to move to Austin, but hearing and reading from other desis its giving me second thoughts. I could be wrong completely, but wanted to ask y'alls thoughts. What would you recommend now if you were to move? And what area would you suggest? Thanks.</p>
