                    <p class="content">For a few months, an account known as "Vividprowess" on twitter has gone viral among Indophobic /anti - desi circles. Because what is apparanetly a Jewish nationalist account was community noted to be an Indian from the slums of uttar pradesh. Massive amounts of hate , racism , and memes in the vein of "surgery to remove India's tongue from Israel's ass" among others were propagated whenever that account posted/ using that account's posts as an embeded tweet. 

But of course, community notes are not definitive proof- it's just a statement somebody can write , and others can agree with. "Colonialism benefited India" under a british made Bengal famine post can become a communtiy note, becuase somebody will write it and a lot of people will upvote it. 

A famous doxxer of anti - southasian  racist accounts, @/fedamshaa (he was the one responsible for doxxing accs. of leonardia jonie, barry , garbage human- esp the fact that the dude r\*ped a fish in the past, among various others) has now found that the guy behind vividprowess is not only jewish, he deliberately hid behind the accusations of being Indian to avoid antisemitic (or anti zionist more accurately) hate towards himself , and instead direct that hate towards Indians. It's insane how a people will just pin zionist hate on Indians now, and not even attempt to verify befire letting lose their racist bile, as if the concern was never about zionism, they just need an excuse for anti indian/ anti- desi hatred. This is also a lesson for the "full support" squad, that zionists will casually hide behind mislabelled Indian identites, if it means they can avoid the heat and misdirect it towards brown folks.
