I stumbled across this post from some Iranian-American woman coping over Dev Patel's white girlfriend. First of all, I don't see why it's an Iranian girls business who South Asian men date. Police your own men. Most of us wouldn't date Muslim women anyway.

Secondly, she is so bitter about "brown" men dating white women that it just made me and my white gf laugh at her. It's posts like these that let me know we are winning. To my fellow South Asian men...get with white girls and watch the entire world squirm with discomfort. I revel in the dirty looks from bitter brown women and angry white men when I'm out with my fianc√©. We are WINNING.
