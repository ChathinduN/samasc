                    <p class="content">Ok i have to rant that every time i see an anti indian comment we like the comment instead of reporting so everyone sees it or write the worst comebacks like wash ur ass toilet paper. Or bring me your mom like i understand i would probably be hackled in real life but online cmon we have answer properly or not answer at all. It's not hard to reply african and Pakistani or bangldeahi comments because we know them but with whites we research a little bit to hurt their sentiment. </p>
