                    <div class="content"><p>Here's the TLDR if you don't want to go through the entire thing:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Take Travel Photos or Use Scenic Backdrops</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn How To Pose In Masculine Ways</strong></li>
<li><strong>Show Different Emotions and Authenticity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Get A Pro To Both Take Photos AND Edit For The Female Gaze</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Boom, more matches, easy peasy.</p>

<p>Anyways, as Asian men, we know that we face unique challenges on platforms like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge because of cultural stereotypes and biased algorithms. Enough studies have shown similar things like AMs needing to make $247,000 more than a white male just to get the same response rate.</p>

<p>So we could just say that dating apps only depend on being good looking and of the right race. Which isn't wrong, per se, but incomplete (not to mention defeatist). There are ways to try to get on the good side of the algorithm, so let's break down what's worked for my and my clients.</p>

<p><strong>1. Use Scenic Backdrops</strong><br />
A Hinge study found that travel photos increase likes by 30%, but only 3.4% of men include them. Women want to see you in interesting environments that showcase your lifestyle.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: Find a location that stands out: a rooftop, a botanical garden, or even a well-lit street. Your photos should make women curious about your life.</p>

<p><strong>2. Master Your Pose</strong><br />
Awkward, stiff poses are an instant turnoff. Learn how to stand confidently and use subtle tricks to highlight your best features.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: Push your chin forward to define your jawline. Practice “action poses” like adjusting your jacket or leaning casually against a wall. These small changes make a huge difference.</p>

<p><strong>3. Capture Authentic Emotion</strong><br />
Women swipe right on photos that feel genuine. If all your photos have a deadpan or overly serious look, it’s not going to work.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: Experiment with a variety of expressions: smiling with teeth, a mysterious smirk, or even a brooding look away from the camera. Authenticity is key.</p>

<p><strong>4. Get Professional Help</strong><br />
Go beyond just using a a skilled photographer. Find someone who can edit by highlighting your masculine energy and make your photos pop without looking overly fake or catfishy.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: Invest in a professional shoot and editing. Photographers know how to work with lighting, composition, and editing to make you look your best while keeping it natural.</p>

<p>This resulted in a bunch of my clients going from zero matches, to 50, even a 100 match. So now many of them average 2 to 4 dates with women per week. One student, obviously an outlier but one who worked hard on it, got 600 matches!</p>

<p>Or you can watch the video I made that goes into both much more detail <strong>AND gives examples</strong> of both good photos and how to pose and get said photos.</p>
