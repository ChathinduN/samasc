                    <div class="content"><p>I generally don't believe in conversation starters and proactively go with the flow in social situations.</p>

<p>But the most commonly heard phrase nowadays is don't be "boring".</p>

<p>For me all topics are interesting and never made a distinction between boring and interesting conversations (unless I'm forced into the conversation/situation). Neither do I speak in length or ramble.</p>

<p>Let's say I'm a software engineer who is into motorbikes, cars, food, stock market, crypto, travel, writing, stand up comedy.</p>

<p>What are some "interesting" and "non-boring" conversation starters or topics that you would suggest?</p>
