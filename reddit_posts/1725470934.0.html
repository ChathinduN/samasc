                    <p class="content">speaking from my experience, brown girls say stuff like
 “oh you’re too skinny”  

i’m tall so putting on weight is a bitch

“why do your wear studs and chains, who are you trying to be”

I do regular skin care and get a haircut every 4-6 weeks and they find that feminine. Like bro i got clear skin and a nice beard and fade every-time. When i look good I feel good.

On dating apps like Hinge and Bumble I do well but on dil mil, it’s pretty dry for some reason.

my current GF is asian and they also make remarks about that, they say i should find a nice indian girl and they say stuff like “oh you like girls who got lighter skin”

like dude all my life, all the girls i’ve liked are brown women in my school and classes but they all said no to me.

It’s not that i don’t want brown girls, it’s that they don’t want me

anyone else experience this </p>
