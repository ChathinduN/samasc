                    <div class="content"><p>So I spend a lot of time on this subreddit and yeah I know another post about dating something yall don’t wanna see. But so far from what I’ve read and seen personally, it seems if you wanna date outside your race properly (not just white but anyone), maybe the US is the best shot for you.</p>

<p>I’m in Canada and this is probably the worst place for interracial specifically brown people, but I think the UK and Australia are slightly better for brown but not to the level of the US and from my gatherings I’ll explain why. </p>

<p><em>Desi culture and presence does not prevail as hard in the US as it does in Canada, UK etc</em></p>

<p>In communities like Canada, although it does promote multiculturalism and brands itself as a melting pot of all cultures, it’s really not. There’s no Canadian identity or culture. The white Canadians don’t want anything to do with desi Canadians it’s blatantly obvious. The desi culture in Canada is absolutely massive and honestly if you want desi girls, imo there’s no better place. Just have a good social circle. </p>

<p>American culture puts a heavy emphasis on having a true American identity and Americanizing yourself. It doesn’t matter what your background is, but the morals emphasized in the United States is that above all, you are an American. There’s a sense of identity and belonging and the culture is evident for that. If you’re a westernized brown boy who just keeps in shape, maintains yourself and does everything right, it may not be as good as your white counterparts but you’re not gonna be handicapped either. In some cases, you might be seen as novelty. </p>

<p>The point of this post is that location really <em>DOES</em> matter if these things are important to you. The world and the media wants to keep projecting that Americans are all racist and hateful people but from what I’ve seen there’s a lot of good people there who don’t really care if you’re brown. Just stand your ground and become the best version of yourself and don’t put white, Latina, black, Asian etc woman on a pedestal, let alone any woman. You also can’t be antisocial or weird. Just be cool. </p>

<p>Please let me know your stories and if you agree or disagree. Canada is still doable if you’re truly a catch, but for the most part it’s not. </p>
