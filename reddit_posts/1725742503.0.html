                    <p class="content">All right gentlemen so today's topic is Testosterone which is the primary male hormone. In the present day we are seeing the epidemic of low levels of T levels in men. A direct result of this the huge number of weak men we see in today's world.

Ages ago men wouldn't think twice risking life to go on a small wooden boat to reach faraway lands and now men are scared to go talk that cute girl. Sadly, today every masculine entity is under attack and anybody who stands up for men will be termed sexist, misogynist or the favorite phrase toxic masculinity to shut them up. A most famous example of this is Andew Tate even though i don't agree with everything he says, there is a lot of truth to what he says.

The avg T levels in 1950 used be 600-1,000 ng/dL compared to todays of 300-1,000 ng/dl. No wonder men of that era were happier and very masculine.  
Because higher T levels is directly correlated to drive, men with drive will always accomplish no matter how hard it gets.

The most natural response to seeing a beautiful woman is sexual desire, seeing a problem is to fix it. If you don't feel this way sadly my friend, you may have low T levels and need to it checked and fixed.

Here is how things changed when i optimized my t levels more clarity of thought, easier to lose stubborn fat, more muscle mass, will power to do hard things even though its not enjoyable, getting comfortable with all the uncertainties life throws at you and dealing with them, better sexual performance.

Things which help increase T levels:  
Lifting weights (Yup i told you before go to the fucking gym), Quitting porn (it makes you weak), Eliminate use of plastic in your life,

Supplements:  
Zinc and Magnesium, Shilajit and Ashwagandha (Ayurveda got it right centuries ago, Huberman confirms it) - I cant recommend these that would be medical advice so consult a medical professional before.

Until next time, I will leave you with one of my favorite quote:

**"Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, andÂ weak men create hard times "- Michael Hopf**</p>
