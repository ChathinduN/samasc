                    <p class="content">The hate that the Indian diaspora receives is a political move to keep the Indians in check and not allow them to overtake the USA. India is projected to be a $15 trillion dollar economy in the next 20-30 years. 
The working population of India is quite young and it will age slowly compared to China ( because of One child policy). 

Boys you all are looking at a very small picture. It is a very deep-rooted issue. Allow me to explain.  This is a small part of a huge geopolitical move. The aim of the West (when I say the West, it’s mainly the USA) is to stop India’s potential 7% GDP growth per year. India is projected to be a 10-15 trillion dollar economy in the upcoming future. It’s closer than you think. If India becomes a 15 trillion dollar economy it would be another snake (China) in its backyard. The only real superpower in South Asia is India (no hate for any other South Asian country but I am speaking facts). It is very eminent

•	⁠Farmers' protest is not an internal uprising but a properly funded one by some sources.
•	⁠Pakistan’s new regime trying to get in bed with the USA.
•	⁠Rise of conflicts in Burma which indirectly supports the Kuki’s tribe to start an uprising in Manipur. A small tribe like the Kuki’s has unlimited ammunition and weaponry to fight against the government.
•	⁠The fall of Bangladesh was artificially created by the USA since Sheikh Hasina did not allow the USA to make a Christian country ( Kuki’s, Chittagong & St.Martin Island) & set up military bases to keep India and China at bay.
•	⁠The rise of online hate against the Indian diaspora which was killing it in the last decade ( one prominent example is International Yoga Day & huge levels of celebrations of Diwali everywhere in the world).

This is a proper agenda that is being discussed behind the doors! I’ll make a post on this!

This is just the tip of the iceberg, if you look deep into all the recent events of India and its relationship with the west, it has taken a toll simply because Indian economy is the only one which is not going to cripple down. 

I will not lie, Indian economy has its own issues but they can be solved very quickly which is scary to the US hegemony. 

This exact scenario reminds me of the peak of Maratha empire and how they fought against 
- Mughals 
- Afghans 
- Nawabs 
- Dutch 
- Portuguese 
- French 
- English 
and they then won and established an empire. 

The other scenario might be that India might become a puppet state like Japan or Germany. </p>
