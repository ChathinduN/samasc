This is why this song gives a blueprint to how to dismantle racism towards desi’s 

The Chorus argues that any distinctions made within the ethnic group are irrelevant to the majority to group,(Anglo Indians, fobs, abd’s, educated desi’s etc)

‘Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga’

In the first first he explains how real empowerment stems from the accumulation of assets

‘I told him, "Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama renting
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it" ‘

Also not to get caught up in consumerism and toxic relationships 

‘I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginning
I coulda bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feeling? Dumbo’

‘You wanna know what's more important than throwing away money at a strip club? Credit’

Avoid taking loans and look to taking risks on a possible financial lucrative opportunities

‘Y'all out here still taking advances, huh?
Me and my niggas taking real chances, uh’
