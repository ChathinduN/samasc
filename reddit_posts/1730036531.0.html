(And don't give the "open your own film house" arguement , I don't work in showbiz/entertainment)</a></h2>

<p>A significantly larger chunk of Indian diaspora men occupy positions like producers, directors , or own production houses compared to women. No Indian women, not even Mindy kaling, has acheived the level of success of M Night shyalman, or Dhar Mann. Then why is it that we don't create romcoms, preferably interracial romcoms(with any race of of women, not just white) films like this? And instead are perfectly fine with slaving for overlords of other races ?  </p>

<p>Relevant because if you google the movie "Picture this" you'll see that it has multiple Indian women working behind the scenes to bring the movie to light:- script writer, producer and many other significant roles are all Indian women- and thats exactly how it's done in a industry as competitive as hollywood . A black male producer by himself (talking abt the 2000 era when the black male protags weren't ubiquitous) won't be able to bring black stories, he needs a black scriptwriter, probably a black director, a production house/publisher owned by black men etc. To a smaller extent it's same for Poc women , although they have a significant advantage- its all laid out for ethnic women bec white/other race men will happily let them proceed with these stories in the name of diversity if it features a male lead of their (white/other ) race. </p>

<p>Like we got Acolyte some months ago, written and produced by black women, and it got every lib left feminist type women thristing after the asian lead Manny jacinto. Same for Heartstopper- so many latina and white women fans, and they all joke how the hapa east asian guy is the hottest in the show (relevant because heartstopper has a obscenely large female fanbase. ). But it didn;t come out of nowhere. East asian men have established themsleves as an "acceptable face" in hollywood by systematically taking up various filmaking roles, uniting,(the most imp part, and where desi guys fail horribly) and featuring multiple stories involving east asian male leads. So you've got women casting them left and right in romantic/ thirst trap type roles (same for percy jackson, while most women fans find aryan cute, the hapa east asian guy playing luke castellan is absolutely thirsted over )</p>

<p>.Note that this growth in EA male representation in hollyywod/ european/ western  movies has a completely independent trajectory from Kdramas /Kpop. Korea's hallyu wave had absolutely none to minimal role in it- the enitre credit goes to EA male diaspora itself. So I don't think Indian Mainland's boomer 40 yr uncle - 20 yr female eye candy "romance" movies are responsible for this predicament we are in. Altough it would certainly help if mainlanders burn every indian film industry to the ground-</p>

<p>even [south](https://x.com/Voizeofsoul/status/1849707660968411375) indian ones (RRR was the exception, not the norm)</p>

<p>Dev patel did his own action movie a few months ago (the type of stuff  I like to see) but the problem is that </p>

<p>1)Indian/Desi  diaspora guys are not making rom coms, and especially those catering to the female gaze (so some bullshit london based "romance " stories featuring uggos like himesh patel, or kumail nannjaini don't count- sorry for the harsh language, but it's true. And mid to outright ugly desi guys form the majority of our rom com rep, with chads like sendhil or raymond either not being given roles, or not being given a chance with the leading lady. Ginny and georgia is an egregious example.)</p>

<p>2)Diaspora filmakers are not uniting to bring these stories to the front. Again, search some articles about "Picture this" or basically any hit interracial movie/ show featuring indian women and white/ east asian men (Eg. "One Day"). Multiple Indian women unite to bring their escaping fetish to the big screen. Like absolute determination to make sure the movies get made, even though most of them get terrible to middling reviews, with the rare likes of "One day" or "Never have I ever" making the entire effort worth it. </p>

<p>And I have a feeling this movie is going to get viral success. The male lead, hero fiennes tiffin is a very very popular actor - the archetypical wattapad crush , esp after he starred in the "After" adapations. Simone is going to get some racist hate from his primarily white/latina/east asian fanbase because of this, and the people behind are going to miss no chance to use this to pity advertise the movie .Picture what happened with "One day" and ambika mod, and multiply it with 1000- the ML actor wasn't even popular, novel reader's primary complaint was that the FL role should have been a white women -</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hero has an indefinitely larger worship base , and it is going to cause Avantika rapunzel levels of controversy and engagement (another case where the hate was slight, but was absolutely overblown by her defenders to the point you would think people were sending avantika death threats.) to promote the movie. </p>

<p>The depressing part is that i'm seeing quite a few Desi male producers, or franchise owners actually promoting East asian or latino men in the name of diversity. Consider Dharr Mann, the guy who made Alan Chikin Chow go globally viral by featuring him in his vids in goofy romantic/male lead roles. He portarys white, east asian, latino and sometimes black men in romantic lead roles. He has featured Indian women, including lily singh, and many other comedians in his vids. He has <em>never</em> featured a Indian/ desi man in any thirst inducing role though. Which makes no sense.</p>

<p>So yeah discussion time: what is stoppping us from doing this? And how do we improve in this aspect ? Any ideas , discussion, personal anecdotes (I'm especially looking for this) of desi guys you know who are working for more desi male rep in modelling, movies/entertainment media, social media and so on. Or it truly over for us and most Indian dudes working in filmmaking are Dharr Mann levels of unaware and blue pilled?</p>

<p>And also, do you know of any upcoming rom com/ or other projects coming up that feature good looking desi guys in thirst worthy roles? (Doesn't necessarily have to be romance- case in point, the amount of thirst the lead in "Dexter" gets). I already know about shooter in "the perfect couple", and others that are part of ongoing shows like Assad Zaman in "interview with vampires", that one dude in three body problem and others. I'm asking for upcoming shows/movies.</p>
